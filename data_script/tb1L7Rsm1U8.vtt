[Music]

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.859
hey guys welcome back to the bench it is

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.830
yet another amazing day and I have yet

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.859
another amazing project to share with

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.670
you guys I have here a solid silver

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.820
flask it was made in Sheffield in the

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.239
United Kingdom in the year 1900 by James

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.719
Dixon and Sons silversmiths now the

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.379
inside of the lid has a cork and you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.780
can't see it but I'll make sure to add

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.700
in the high resolution gallery where you

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.500
can see on the inside it's got a sort of

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.680
cam mechanism that rides this lip and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.629
keeps everything sealed so there's a

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.030
constant pressure on the cork both of

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.430
the cork and the cam mechanism have worn

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.649
out because the flask is almost a

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.080
hundred and twenty years old but we're

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.409
going to fix that follow along you can

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.990
see here how much where both of the cork

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.390
and catch mechanism have endured over

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.330
the years I'll start by using a pair of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.340
fine tipped diamond tweezers to remove

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.700
the old cork it's built in layers rather

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.890
than a solid piece which was a bit of an

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.110
interesting discovery the discoloration

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.240
that's visible in the deeper layers is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.640
the result of microbial growth caused by

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.340
the layered pork being impossible to

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.810
sterilize properly

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:48.980
[Music]

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.750
to begin refurbishing the cam mechanism

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.990
I need to add some silver here so it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.520
off to the Orion I've got the Orion set

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.710
to rapid mode using it's a triangle

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.610
waveform

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.860
I'll start by tacking the edge of my

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.140
sheet in place add two kilowatts of

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.250
power using 12 millisecond pulses once

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.140
I'm satisfied that the sheet won't end

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.690
or move during the welding process

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.880
I'll ramp that up to three kilowatts of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.610
power and 15 millisecond pulses to begin

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.490
my initial welding pass that's got my

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.220
silver sheet nicely adhered exactly

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:46.459
where I need it the precise control the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.310
Orion gives me over how much and in what

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.410
manner energy is delivered to the piece

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.959
actually lets me begin shaping the metal

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.750
with the Orion itself rather than with

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:60.660
abrasives to that end I'll begin the

00:02:60.660 --> 00:03:02.760
shaping process by cranking the power up

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.400
one last time to five kilowatts and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.830
increasing my pulse lengths to 25

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.450
milliseconds

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:21.540
a little more time shaping and a quick

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:30.810
trip to the steamer and here we are now

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.030
I want to take a second guys and make a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.650
point about something that's very

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.760
important to us

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.819
now the blast that I'm working on here

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.980
is almost a hundred and twenty years old

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.319
and I don't want to destroy any of the

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.690
authenticity or anything that is the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.590
bona fides

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.049
of the age of the piece so the name of

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.440
the game here is minimal invasion I want

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.110
to do the absolute least that I possibly

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.319
can to accomplish what I set out to do

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.079
and that's what makes the Orion so

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.420
amazing I'm going to get into shaping

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.220
this tab and then we're going to record

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.459
this bad boy I'll use a fine cut file to

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.190
shape and re bevel the outside surface

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:22.100
of the catch tab once I'm happy with

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.889
that a combination of a square file and

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.919
that same fine cut file will assist in

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.990
recreating the bottom surface of the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:38.580
catch I'll have to get up close and

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.200
personal to do the edge detailing

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.090
there's not a lot of room to work here

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.190
which means I'll really have to take my

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.190
time

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.140
[Music]

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.390
mr. a bit more shaping with a fine grit

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.370
silicon wheel and a quick trip to the

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.070
steamer our newly refurbished catch tab

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:05.200
is looking good check out how perfectly

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.330
this cork fits our flask I'll have to

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.610
cut it down to just the right length to

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.230
fit in here

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:33.159
[Music]

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.900
with a little bit of coaxing our new

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.360
pork pops right into place in its new

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.210
home a quick twist and untwist of the

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.460
top to check the new fit shows me that

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.009
it's perfect and this flask is ready for

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:55.129
another century of service and there you

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.620
have it guys I am super thrilled with

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.479
the way that this came out and it is so

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.789
cool it's a hundred and twenty years old

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.159
it's solid silver I mean you can taste

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.860
the character when you just look at it

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.229
it's amazing I'm really happy that I

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.789
found out about the way that the corks

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.979
go in and layers so I took all of that

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.050
old nacelle all of the gross Ness and

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.000
we've replaced it with a solid piece of

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.400
natural cork we've preserved the

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.620
integrity of the piece and the piece

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.840
itself will last for another hundred

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.569
years we always want to hear what you

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:28.400
guys have to tell us down in the comment

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.779
section and of course if there's

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:32.759
something you'd like to see let us know

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.860
I always hope you'll hit that like and

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.199
subscribe button and until the next time

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.569
we see you it is always a pleasure

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.810
having you with us here at the mansion

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.990
