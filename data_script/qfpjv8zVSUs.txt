Hey everyone and welcome back!
Today's tutorial is going to be on my weekly face mask routine I Hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and let's get started!
So there are three simple ingredients we are going to be using in our facial masks and it's one tablespoon of plain yogurt.
I'm going to be using Greek yogurt because Greek yogurt works the best.
One teaspoon of warm honey and one teaspoon of dry oats.
We're going to be mixing these together and applying it on our clean face.
So now that I have my three ingredients mixed up in a little, Bowl I'm going to be applying it on my case.
So I'm just going to be taking the little and so we're just gently spreading the yogurt, honey, and oatmeal onto skin surface.
This feels really good and the best part about it is that it's edible so it's really safe.
You don't don't worry about any harsh ingredients playing on the side.
So after I'm done applying my facial mask, I'm going to let it sit 10 to 15 minutes.
I Really love this facial mask that contains yogurt because yogurt is great for all skin types.
You can use it for dry skin.
You can use it for sensitive skin.
you can use it for oily skin.
Yogurt is your best solution and it also moisturizes your skin and it helps sun damaged skin.
So I Really like this and I hope you guys enjoy it too.
So after we let our facial masks sit for 10 to 15 minutes, we are going to be washing it with lukewarm water.
So I just removed the facial mask for my face and my face is feeling extremely soft.
It's very moisturized and I Hope you guys give it a try.
