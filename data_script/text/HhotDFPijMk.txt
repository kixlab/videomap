Already Happy morning afternoon here in Seattle Second day of sunshine that we've had and I've got some prepared soil.
I Got this really cool product called Seed Sheet Seed Yeah!
CG nut seed sheets and I got to grow your herbs I Was fascinated because it's just a one sheet item full of seeds.
I'm going to pull it out and show it to you.
There's the seeds right now and what I've got is basil, cilantro, dill parsley, onion, greens, and sorrel.
This is literally one of the easiest things for busy and semi lazy gardeners such as myself.
I just kind of took a pot, had some soil in it, moved it around, make sure there was no clumps, put a like tablespoon of this organic food in there and then I watched a few videos on how you do this.
They say put the seeds down.
They also say to stake it.
okay digging stakes out right now and so I'm going to place those cakes in there and then they tell you to spray which I don't have a sprayer.
so I'm just going to drizzle a little water on top of my thing here and whoa, they're starting to shift, They're starting to change and we're going to get a lot of rain here.
You know, Heaven forbid Seattle Have you know too much?
Sun So there's rain coming tonight so I am not too worried about these guys getting water but says to spray on daily and I can show you my other one and how well it's doing.
About 15 days in this is actually the seed sheet salad version and every single one of my little seeds is putting out some sprouts.
This one maybe doesn't look so hot but anyways it's brand new sprouting like 14 days in 11 to 14 days in things were happening we've had literally no Sun except for the past two days we've had no Sun for a couple months.
So I'm very happy with this product and I think it's awesome and a lot of fun.
So I'll put the links to the seed sheet below This video and the organic fertilizer have a lot of fun!
