Ah, alright, now that we've got our rap on, let's show how it works with the real baby.
A fussy one at that.
Put your baby in one arm and push down the label.
You want to reach down, push the X apart and take the inside piece, loop baby's leg into it, pull it up over the baby's shoulder, and then spread out the fabric.
Wider you spread the fabric, the more comfortable it will be for you and baby.
Take the next loop, put baby's legs through, pull the fabric up over to the bum and the shoulder again.
you're almost done.
No babies, no longer crying.
You want to find the label piece to the side, pull baby's legs through, and pull it up over the back.
You can either cover baby's seat or leave them out if it's kind of worn out.
And that's how you put your baby in your sleepy wrap.
