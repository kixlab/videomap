Hi I'm Aaron Henley professional makeup artist and today I'm going to show you a face washing regimen using a washcloth.
So we have our washcloth right here and all you need to do is to add water.
So I'm going in getting our washcloth wet.
if you have a sink at home that works better and so what we're going to do is with the damp side, this is just to show you how to exfoliate and the fibers on the washcloth are the great exfoliator itself, so you don't have to use a face wash with it if you don't want to.
If you're removing makeup, then that's primarily a good choice, but if we're just going to exfoliate the skin barefaced, then we just need to take our pointer finger and massage it into the skin.
A lot of people forget that wash clothes are really great for exfoliating skin.
People resort to loofahs primarily these days, but a good old washcloth can really help liven up the skin and get the dead skin cells that we need to get off.
Small little circles are suggested, which can really help massage the skin and abrupt anything that might need to come off.
Gentle strokes that we're not scrubbing the face hard, this is just a gentle scrub get, especially getting the crevices of the nose and around the mouth where dry skin would be a little more prone to this time of year.
Another thing, especially if we have chapped lips in the winter, it's really great to just go over with our washcloth or a toothbrush.
Our skin is getting exfoliated and it's looking great I'm Erin Henley and I just showed you how to exfoliate with a washcloth.
You.
