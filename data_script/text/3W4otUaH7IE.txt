This is the triple-t a Chinchilla cage that I got a few days ago.
I've only had my chin shells for about 3-4 weeks so this dub getting used to me only been bit once, but they've got these little catches on the balls, come with them and I've got hay in two of them, could be in green tea and food in the other two little pellets that they on this level.
I've I've had to put towels down one because they don't like the way stay in there.
it feels on their feet and they can get bumblefoot which is quite painful and my sister hasn't made me my case liners yet but in this level.
I've got the house with the both of the men I me and my niece made these toys.
we got different bits of wardens and police got these from Chinchillas to shop and everything's good price and made that one over there and the football ones from Pets at Home I think and I've also had to put towels on the ramps because once again they can get bumblefoot and it can be open sores on their feet which is really painful on the second level.
I haven't got much because map everything still hasn't arrived yet but this is another toy with different bits of wood bamboo finger traps that they absolutely love an attachable to that they don't really like lot one from Pets at home, another one there that they maybe it's just tends to sit on it really.
In the third level I've got a hammock that only Doris really tends to use but they just like chewing the label that's from little friends that wasn't very expensive.
They've got the dust bath there says it's not supposed to get dust everywhere but it does.
that's from pets at home.
Made this myself again that's coconut and thick cardboard bit would.
we've got the other food bowls with hay and pellets in and oh yeah, that, that's all I've got in there really until everything else comes.
I've got some more hammocks but I haven't put them up yet.
Say not used to it, but look a lot better with the K2 liners in.
So yeah, that's it.
