Fit for Dogs Knowing your dog's heart rate and recovery rate by Dr. Liz Devitt Canine Sports Medicine Specialist.
Hi, I'm Dr. Liz Devitt, your Canine Sports Medicine veterinarian.
One of the things I want you to know about your dog is their resting heart rate.
You won't have a stethoscope at home like me, but you don't need one.
You can feel your dog's heart rate right about where the elbow meets the chest.
On a medium-sized dog.
Like Emmy, a normal heart rate is going to be between 80 and 110 beats per minute.
Larger dogs have slower heart rates.
Smaller dogs have faster heart rates.
One other place that you can feel for the heart rate is to feel the pulse in the femoral vein right where the upper thigh meets the body.
Just lay the flat of your hand inside her leg and you can feel the pulse there too.
Knowing your dog's heart rate is important because you want to know what's normal for your dog.
When you take your dog out to exercise, the heart rate's going to go up.
What you want to know is the resting heart rate and how quickly they recover back to that after exercise.
Dog covers quickly, is in good condition.
If it takes five to ten minutes for your dog to get back to normal heart rate, you've gone too long, too hard, or too fast, so know it's normal for your dog.
And then you know how well your exercise program is going.
You.
