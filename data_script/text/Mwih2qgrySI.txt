Hello!
My name is Jessica Craven I'm a Master Gardener and I have my certification in Permaculture Design today.
We're going to talk about using Epsom Salts for tomato gardening.
Now Epson Salt is Magnesium Sulfate.
That's what's in it and a lot of times you'll hear grandmother's or grandfathers say yeah, if you want your tomatoes to really grow great, add Epsom salts and it's because tomatoes could be or the plants could be lacking in magnesium.
Before you add anything like Epsom salts, you want to make certain that your soils really lacking in magnesium.
The best way to do this is of course to test your soil what you want to do.
If you do decide, you need to add Epsom Salts to make your tomatoes grow better is you want to add about a tablespoon or so of Epsom Salts to a gallon of water and then you want to water very carefully at the base of the plant.
You don't want to pour it over fast over your plant because that would cause soil to spray up and land on the plant which could cause different types of pests to then grow in your Tomatoes.
So if you choose to do this, water very very carefully at the base your tomato and wait about a week or so see if you decide.
it makes your plant the foliage more lush and if you find it works then you can continue to add Epsom salts to your tomatoes.
There is caution: I Do want to say you don't want to add too much.
don't do this more than say three or four times during Your growing season.
So there are some tips on using Epsom Salts to grow tomatoes.
