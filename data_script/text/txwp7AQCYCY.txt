Alright Doc positive here with Toph E and Kofi the older little dog here who just had his ass kicked Kofi's a city dog.
he's here in the Poconos, but he lives in Norfolk.
In Norfolk they got a lot of Navy ships but they don't have a lot of deer.
so he saw this little fawn in the backyard.
dad's up here visiting his family.
tofi saw a fawn in the backyard, went to investigate and Mama deer came and kicked his ass.
so he's older guy.
how old is he on da 12 years now 12 years old and at 12 years old he did not have a whole lot of fight in him with that dear.
he's got some wounds on him here as see: Billy you know we got a we got a nasty laceration.
Deer hooves are sharp.
real sharp.
so he's got a laceration on his neck.
He's got a big old bruised ad I Thought he had a broken leg but he's got a big hematoma here on his hip.
Hematoma is a bruise.
He got kicked by a hoof.
He's also got a injury on his back leg.
so Doc positive we're making sure he's stable his colors.
goodbye his color I don't mean he's white I mean his gums.
his mucous membranes are pink.
He's got good capillary refill time.
What I do is I raise his lip, push on his gums, they blanch out to white but they pink back up in one or two seconds.
That's called capillary refill time.
With good capillary refill time.
One of two seconds tells me his blood pressure is good.
He's not likely to be bleeding internally.
We're giving him a shot of antibiotics.
We're giving him a shot of buprenorphine ex is a morphine derivative.
We use a lot dogs for the pain.
We're going to make sure he's stable.
We'll get him sedated and bit, get those wounds sewn up and he says man I Can't wait to get back to the city.
He says we don't have dear, we don't have bear, maybe an occasional squirrel or sewer rat.
So but uh, he's uh, he'll be okay and lived to tell the story to all his friends back in Norfolk By now you you.
