What we have here is a slackline.
I've been learning how to walk on, walk, walk on, walk on it and I lay on it.
laying on.
its pretty easy.
kinda hang out.
use your feet stabilizers, kind of push that way, push that way with your left foot, that way, with your left foot, you start going one way, push it that way with your right foot, you start going that way so or you can sort of use your toe and kind of hook it around and grab it, then use like that and so it's pretty easy because you're solo.
Let's grab it.
Uh, it's just easy.
Other thing is walking on it and that's like a bit more challenging and working on that come out and golden at it.
But I'm getting better.
So here we go.
We're not walking on it, just standing on.
there we go.
I Feel like that.
See there's other slack line marks, the two-by-four boat I think it's a little under five feet.
it gets wedged in the closet and another two by four and your webbing here and the bowline on one end and just gets looped through to give a loop.
Then it attaches to the two-by-four like that and this just get switched in there like that.
So when you have this makes it, the the webbing come out sort of on a vertical line.
So what you do is you do this taco shell fold.
The taco shell fold looks like that.
Basically what it does is it makes it so that it comes out in a horizontal line horizontally once it unfolds and so it just gets wedged in there and then it just gets hooked onto the UM the handle of the ladder for the bunk bed over there.
That's it.
