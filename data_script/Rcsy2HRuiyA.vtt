00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.460
hello everybody and welcome back to

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.470
another video so today I'll be showing

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.690
you all how to make class time without

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.480
any fake snow and this recipe is really

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.490
really simple you can literally get all

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.429
these ingredients from Dollar Tree like

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.279
ingredient similar to these so yeah it's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.289
really simple and affordable recipe so

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.050
let's just go first you'll need a bowl

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.539
and something to mix with you also need

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.490
some glue it doesn't matter if you use

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.340
white glue or clear glue just some glue

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.080
so I'm using some lotion just to make my

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.369
son softer but you'll have to do this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.200
and also I'm going to be adding some

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.120
food coloring but like once again you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.500
don't have to do this you'll need a

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.989
slime activator and I didn't using 1

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.200
tablespoon of borax mixed with 1 cup of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.550
water so the alternative for unfixed I'm

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.160
using some diapers and one diaper makes

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.940
a lot of takes no so beyond your lot and

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.890
it got this from Dollar Tree and I just

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.800
notice that there's anything since there

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.570
that's really cool just like to need

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.570
diapers so first you are going to be

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.970
putting the desired amount of glue into

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.610
your bowl and this is a basic slime

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.740
recipe the only difference is that

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.630
you're adding a bit more activator than

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.869
you usually do and then after it's hat

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.759
you're going to add in some of your food

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.860
coloring or lotion and this step is

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.900
totally optional you can choose to skip

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.750
it or not and once you've done that then

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.729
you're going to add in some of your

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.040
activator and once again but in more

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.070
than you usually would to over activate

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.390
it alright so I am now done over

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.890
activating my side and by over

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.619
activating I mean like adding too much

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.229
activator so it's not super stretchy it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.479
rips apart pretty easy but it's time

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.090
just felt anyway so yeah I am done doing

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.640
that so now I'm gonna like set it aside

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.979
I'm going to put it right there and now

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.600
we're gonna take your bowl again and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.130
fill it up now have a bowl of water you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.820
need about that much in you like a nice

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.040
mountain water just soak your whole

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.439
diaper in so I'm gonna open once I said

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.509
oh here it is you're just gonna go ahead

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.979
and open it up I don't even know

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.040
to work diapers whoa this is big okay

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.909
maybe I do need a bigger bowl for this I

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.560
might need a bigger bowl for this but

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.659
usually need to get a bigger one anyway

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.069
so now you're just gonna pop it into

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.209
your water and I guess I'm gonna like

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.340
I'm not sure what I'm going to do

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.989
there's pop it into your water and then

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.970
make sure like all the areas are soaked

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.610
and everything and just leave it there

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.519
to soak for a bit it is all done you're

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.040
gonna go take your scissors I feel like

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.890
I should probably wet it some more but I

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.870
don't feel like any more water so you're

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.120
gonna take your scissors and then

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.569
they're just gonna cut open the diaper

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.959
so take like this upper sort of like

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:60.700
layer just kind of hard to show you guys

00:02:60.700 --> 00:03:03.849
take just like upper area and make a

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:15.970
snip in it and start cutting just want

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.980
to sleep I keep on trying it until you

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.489
see our Vista okay this is what you will

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:31.750
need for the axle yeah this was I can't

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.250
speak properly this is what you'll need

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.950
for the fake snow so there are some like

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.440
tiny like paper parts and you do not

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.799
want that you're gonna throw that out

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.859
but the other parts you want so I'm

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.310
gonna go ahead and just pump it all in

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.989
pulling out into my bowl okay so I think

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.230
I am done and getting it all out so

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.180
here's all the fake snow I got I

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.639
actually got a lot so I'm going to make

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.470
a bit more time off-camera that's

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.239
because I don't think I got enough for

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.459
the amount of you know fix no I got but

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.780
make sure you don't want any of this

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.910
like paper stuff I don't know if you can

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.160
see if it's like wet paper you do not

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.569
want that stuff in your slice let's go

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.250
ahead and do it out you just want like

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.669
the regular I don't even know what this

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.859
stuff is but yeah so just sort it out

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.959
and then I'm gonna make a bit more slime

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:23.330
and then we're gonna put

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.509
here so beer okay so I have made a bit

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.300
more slime and you can see I didn't mix

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.759
it very well because it's kind of hard

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.099
to mix you know pretty hard slime

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.349
together anyway so now is the moment of

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.629
truth so I'm gonna go ahead and I guess

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.870
just pop it in there okay so now just

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.789
gonna mix it around try to make it all

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.909
stick I feel so weird I feel like I

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:55.460
shouldn't be playing with this stuff but

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.430
I mean it's okay I'm just gonna play

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.449
with it cuz why not so just go ahead and

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.750
mix it and I'll be back once I'm done

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.759
making my class on and this did make a

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.400
bit of a mess but so yeah just make sure

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.919
to do it over like a surface that you

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.139
can easily clean up but anyways here it

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.949
is and just took forever to mix in and

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.229
um just a little like mixing tip I guess

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.090
I would like grab it and I'll twist it

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.620
I'll just like speed up the mixing

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.250
process

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.770
so yeah I'll just do that anyway so here

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.080
it is all done I love it so so much and

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.599
it did get this a bit sticky want to

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.949
zoom in because you're in the diaper

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.319
stuff did have a bit of water in it so

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.750
just add some activator and also if you

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.520
are experiencing so much fallout as I am

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.259
right now like some of the diaper stuff

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.060
is falling I'll just add a bit more I'm

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.740
fine into it and then it should fix it

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.080
so this slime is heavenly I love it so

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.930
much it's exactly like last line um and

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.479
also it made a lot of slime like this is

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.589
my hand my hands by the way is pretty

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.129
big I'm like it's a big big fun a lot

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:60.990
fun huh and if you're wondering are you

00:05:60.990 --> 00:06:02.120
sized for diapers I don't know size for

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.889
diapers is big or not but that's the

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.560
size I used and you can't get this firm

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.909
and I like from the Dollar Tree like a

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:10.099
 5 I can't even speak I'm not

surprised the high impact from Dollar

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.750

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.199
slime this much class line it's insane

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.219
I'm not sure this is in focus cuz right

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.750
