00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.580
welcome to Madrid recipe.com today I am

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.000
making stuffed chili cheese toast this

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.179
is really superb and yummy it gets nice

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.079
double layer of cheese and it just melt

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.329
in your mouth and it makes perfect party

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.070
starter or appetizer or snack dish it's

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.100
just yummy so for that here has some

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.410
bread slices now with the help of back

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.410
of spoon I'm going to press it in the

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.900
middle of this bread just to create some

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.190
space to be able to fit in our cheese

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.140
since we are going to make this into a

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:03.200
chili cheese toast perfect similarly

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.540
repeat the same process with the other

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.640
slice of bread

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.340
perfect that looks done now let's keep

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.980
this aside now take a poll and we are

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.660
going to make our cheese filling

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.500
so take some mozzarella cheese in a bowl

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.090
this is about a cup of mozarella cheese

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.530
in that goes in some diced tomatoes now

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.900
that is optional but it adds that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.060
beautiful color and a little bit of time

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.280
in this chili cheese toast I have

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.280
decided this tomatoes then some

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.810
coriander leaves finely chopped

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.550
coriander leaves and now I'm adding

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.530
green chilies so these are about two to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.940
three green chilies thinly sliced also

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.560
add a little bit of chili flakes that is

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.630
optional but since it's a chili cheese

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.840
toast it has to be nice and spicy

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.130
and a little bit of olive oil do this a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:10.549
good mix

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.950
and here our chilli cheese toast filling

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.609
it's all ready now let's take this bread

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:24.319
and I'm gonna put a slice of cheese on

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.780
this bread and this is what will give

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.040
you the best chili cheese toast look at

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:40.379

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.230
since this is chili cheese toast I'm

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.390
going to sprinkle some chili flakes over

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.969
this cheese slice that is again optional

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.250
if you don't eat spicy food you can just

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:60.549
keep that out and stuff in this cheese

00:02:60.549 --> 00:03:06.940
