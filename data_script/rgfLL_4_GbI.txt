This is a Viva Goldfarb of the six o'clock scramble and I am so excited to show you this soup because not only is it so yummy and kids love it in adults love it, but it is so easy.
it takes about 10 minutes to make total and it's only five ingredients so what could be better?
So it's a ravioli soup with grated zucchini and spinach.
The first thing is I have two cups of chicken or vegetable broth, whatever you prefer in two cups of water boiling over here.
Then I'm just going to add our ravioli.
So while the ravioli is cooking right in the soup, we're just going to grate our zucchini which is super easy on the standing, great, greater and it's even easier if you cut it in half this way.
First, after the ravioli have been cooking for three minutes, which is about how long it takes you to great your zucchini, all you do is you add your zucchini and spinach to the pot.
I'm going to drop the top over here for your veggies and your color.
Once you add your vegetables to the pot with the ravioli and the broth, they just need a minute or two to cook until they just wilt and then you can serve it once you serve your soup in your bowls.
What your family is going to love: You can either use some shredded Parmesan cheese that you bought that way or you can buy a hunk of Parmesan or Parmigiano-reggiano and grade it right over the soup which is also something that my kids love to do themselves right over there.
And then if you like a little freshly ground pepper on top and you have your dinner done, so if you'd like this recipe, don't forget to leave a comment.
