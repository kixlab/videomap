Hi, this is your baby.
This is my crystal ring project.
I Got my magnetic stirrer going and the crystals are growing quite rapidly now.
Aluminum crystals.
They're not edible, you can't eat them, but they look cool.
They're kind of bitter.
Pyramid shaped or diamond shaped.
Yeah, very cool Science project I Had trouble focusing this I Hate all the focus cameras.
They never work very well.
You can't manually focus this thing.
Yeah!
cool Science project.
I'm going to try to enter a science competition for big crystals, but this might take a while yet.
Get this really big.
I'm going to put this in my computer and see how it looks.
Okay, bye for now.
