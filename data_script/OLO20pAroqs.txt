Today we are going to neuter Loose Mooses about an 8 month old black lab and we're going to be using our surgical laser.
We have a sterile hanger piece and we have our laser set.
I'm going to go ahead and turn the laser on and then we'll be turning the vacuum on to make our incision.
[Music] [Music] [music] So as you can see there is no blood in the incision.
When we use the laser, we have removed the first testicle and as you can see it is still bloodless.
You know how both testicles removed and you can see there's just a minimal amount of bleeding in the incision.
So now we'll go ahead and close and our neuter will be finished.
So our incision is now closed and as you can see it's closed us really nicely with the laser.
Having made the incision.
