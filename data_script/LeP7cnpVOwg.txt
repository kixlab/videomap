Hi today!
I'm going to show you how you can feed aloe Vera to your pets.
These are my two dogs.
This little one here is Jersey and then the big one is Coco and they've been taking aloe Vera for about six months now.
I Have an aloe vera leaf here and you just slice off as much as you need.
This is enough for both of my dogs.
Then you cut off the edges on both sides, then put your knife right underneath the top rind and slice it off.
See, then put your knife underneath the gel and slice off the bottom right.
And then this here is your aloe Vera gel.
Then just slice it into little pieces and you can either mix it right in their food or like my dogs like to eat it just plain.
So I just put it right in their bowls.
Now, why would you do this?
Well, Aloe Vera cures diseases.
It prevents diseases if boosts your immune system.
It's packed with vitamins and minerals.
Two years ago it cured my high blood pressure and I've been taking this ever since.
So when my little dog Jersey started getting seizures earlier this year, I decided what the heck.
I'm gonna try this on her too and I did what I showed you and I put it in her food every day and since then she hasn't had a seizure ever again.
So I think people really need this information.
It's important.
It's a miracle.
This is a miracle.
You don't need medication to cure or maintain your diseases, so do your research and give it a try.
This is to your pet's health.
