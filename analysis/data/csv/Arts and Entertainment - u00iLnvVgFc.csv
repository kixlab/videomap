0.57,3.48,alright guys today i have a guitar repair video,goal,goal,goal,
3.69,12.22,what i'm going to be doing today is i'm going to be putting on these graph tech ratio tuning pegs on my nags canai,goal,goal,goal,
13.17,14.76,so let's get into it all right,bridge,bridge,bridge,
14.77,18.78,so this guitar i got last year and it's become one of my favorite guitars that i own,context,context,context,
18.89,25.46,so it came with standard grover tuners but i thought it'd be cool to possibly upgrade it and try something new,context,context,context,
25.51,31.99,so i went online and i did some research and i found out about these graph tech the ratio tuners,tool,tool,tool,
32.19,34.21,and i'm a big fan of graph tech products,side note,side note,side note,
34.22,42.21,i use their saddles on some of my guitars so what's cool about this is each string has its own gear ratio,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
42.26,45.47,and the slogan is precise predictable and fast,side note,side note,side note,
45.54,51.93,so my expectations with these are hopefully a better tuning stability more precise tuning,side note,side note,side note,
52,55.67,that's what i've heard from the research that i've done and all in all,side note,side note,side note,
55.68,57.33,i think it might be a cool little upgrade,side note,side note,side note,
57.4,62.18,so i guess first things first we're going to take off the strings take off the old tuners,instruction,instruction,instruction,
62.25,67.38,and these and these tuners are actually numbered one two three four five six,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
67.39,70.12,so they're very specific to whichever string they're going on,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
70.29,74.9,also i believe these come with a mounting plate so i don't have to do any extra drilling,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
74.91,79.8,it should fit exactly where the old grover tuner holes went,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
80.11,83.02,required tools socket wrench phillips screwdriver,tool,tool,tool,
83.03,84.04,got those,tool,bridge,,
90.89,93.26,ok so i got my old tuners off,status,status,status,
93.31,95.2,and the cool thing about this,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
95.27,104.87,like i said before they come with these mounting plates that fit all the different kinds of tuners whether you have klusons,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
104.88,108.93,or godos or grovers like i do,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
108.98,124.07,so these will mount right onto the whole the original hole that was here with the grover and then i can easily fit this onto the plate and it should fit like a glove,context,tool specification,,
129.8,139.5,alright so like i said before each tuning machine is different so you need to make sure that you put them in the right slots,instruction,instruction,instruction,
139.55,146.73,yeah six is here and right now i have everything sort of loose because i'm not exactly sure how these are going to line up,status,status,status,
149.07,150.87,five four four,status,status,status,
154.61,164.97,i'm going to take him out and then start with the by home ten am,instruction,instruction,instruction,
166.05,171.03,suck it up and justice keep it loose for now,instruction,instruction,instruction,
171.08,175.51,so far this has been a very easy upgrade,context,context,context,
175.66,181.24,i'm not the handiest person when it comes to a guitar repair and all that stuff,side note,side note,side note,
181.25,188.3,i mean i do minimal things in electronics i'm ok with but this is easy,side note,side note,side note,
188.31,196.44,all you need is like two tools so ,context,context,context,
,,i'm just going to tighten these up not over tighten it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
196.45,202.73,but uh just make sure that it's all secure because you don't want anything rattling,justification,instruction,,
203.7,204.69,buzzing,justification,justification,justification,
205.08,207.38,finger tight i think is good enough,instruction,instruction,instruction,
207.42,212.9,i'm just using the socket attachment so i don't have any mega leverage,tool,tool,tool,
213.37,214.42,o k,bridge,bridge,bridge,
214.49,218.26,well let's see if you can see,outcome,outcome,outcome,
218.27,219.65,that's what it looks like,outcome,outcome,outcome,
223.72,224.22,they're,outcome,outcome,outcome,
224.23,228.47,you know they're locking tuners so they're a little bit bulkier than the grovers,outcome,outcome,outcome,
228.52,229.17,ohh yeah,filler,filler,filler,
229.22,230.41,so already i can tell,outcome,outcome,outcome,
230.42,237.01,like the the low east ring is there's much more resistance,outcome,outcome,outcome,
237.49,243.55,if you want numbers they're low east during ratio is thirty nine to one the a string is twenty four to one,outcome,outcome,outcome,
243.64,247.23,the d string it's an electric so thirty five to one,outcome,outcome,outcome,
247.28,251.75,the g string is thirty five to one as well so that should feel the same,outcome,outcome,outcome,
251.76,256.03,yeah the b string is twenty to one and the e string is twelve to one,outcome,outcome,outcome,
256.08,257.61,so i don't know,side note,side note,side note,
257.66,262.91,maybe once i have strings on it i will be able to really figure it out,side note,side note,side note,
263,270.81,but they do feel different and they feel tighter already so i'm hoping that's going to be great for tuning stability,outcome,status,,
270.88,273.91,only one way to find out and that's to a string it up,outcome,status,,
274.16,278.85,and as usual i'm using my favorite strings the dario nyxl,tool,tool,tool,
279.08,285.63,these are the ten to forty six balanced tensions so they're slightly different from a normal ten to forty six,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
285.64,294.29,it goes ten thirteen and a half instead of thirteen seventeen twenty five which is lighter thirty four which is lighter,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
294.3,296.47,because normally it's twenty six,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
296.48,298.97,thirty six right and then forty six on the bottom,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
298.98,305.29,so the b string and the d and h a strings are slightly different,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
312.76,314.67,o i got the strings on,status,outcome,,
314.74,316.51,i stretched them out real good,status,outcome,,
317.91,321.84,one thing i notice is this these tumors are extremely precise,reflection,reflection,reflection,
321.85,324.76,they basically have fine tuning capabilities,reflection,reflection,reflection,
324.83,330.9,yeah i didn't have any problems with tuning up and overshooting the correct pitch,reflection,reflection,reflection,
331.13,334.62,these are really really nice and tight feeling,reflection,reflection,reflection,
334.71,337.58,they definitely feel more solid than the grovers,reflection,reflection,reflection,
338.39,340.36,i would say it's an upgrade for sure,reflection,reflection,reflection,
340.41,347.14,obviously it's going to take a couple of days for things to settle in before i can decide if the tuning stability is any better,reflection,reflection,reflection,
347.15,354.86,but from what i'm feeling and hearing it is definitely a feels better,reflection,reflection,reflection,
356.54,360.36,i feel very confident that all my strings are in tune,reflection,reflection,reflection,
360.4,365.19,i bought these from stewmac but you can find them from graph tech directly amazon,tool specification,tool,,
365.26,366.99,i'll put a link down in the description,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
367.04,374.77,so yeah it's kind of too early to tell but i would probably buy another set and try them out on one of my strats,reflection,reflection,reflection,
374.82,378.95,i think it's a good upgrade and i would recommend to you guys,reflection,reflection,reflection,
378.96,385.68,if you have any guitars that aren't staying in tune the greatest or if you're just looking to upgrade what you have,reflection,reflection,reflection,
385.95,387.86,i think this would be a good move,reflection,reflection,reflection,
388.03,390.22,super easy to install,reflection,reflection,reflection,
390.27,394.7,like i said with these mounting plates you don't need to drill anything,reflection,reflection,reflection,
394.71,398.24,they make it super easy so i think it's a great buy,reflection,reflection,reflection,
