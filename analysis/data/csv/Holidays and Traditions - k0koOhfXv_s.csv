113.99,124.91,and like i said i just tied it in a knot to make sure those two pieces stay together and then i'm going to just take the ends and wrap it in the opposite ways,instruction,instruction,instruction,
124.92,135.24,going around one way and then i'll use the other string to wrap it around the opposite way eventually to just tie the ends into a knot,instruction,instruction,instruction,
