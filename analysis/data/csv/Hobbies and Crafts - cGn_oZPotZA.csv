0.64,1.53,what's up guys,opening,opening,opening,
1.58,4,so today i'm gonna show you how to make this fake neon light,goal,goal,goal,
4.06,4.97,neon light,side note,side note,side note,
5.06,6.65,neon neon neon,side note,side note,side note,
6.66,6.93,neon,side note,side note,side note,
6.94,7.19,neon,side note,side note,side note,
7.2,7.47,neon,side note,side note,side note,
7.48,8.5,neon neon,side note,side note,side note,
23.53,26.62,so first off a quick thank you to squarespace for sponsoring this video,advertisement,advertisement,advertisement,
26.83,31.03,if you guys need to make a website you go ahead and make your rad with squarespace,advertisement,advertisement,advertisement,
32.23,37.3,ok so first thing you need to do is find an image or like a line drawing,instruction,instruction,instruction,
37.87,38.68,now the line drawing,instruction,instruction,instruction,
38.69,42.9,you need to be able to like connect all the lines so that it just be like one continuous line,instruction,instruction,instruction,
44.59,46.9,so like this wouldn't work,context,context,context,
46.91,47.62,that didn't work,context,status,status,
47.63,48.32,i messed up,context,status,status,
48.43,53.11,you need to be able to like draw the whole thing without having to lift your pen or your marker,instruction,instruction,instruction,
53.71,54.86,next i took the l wire,tool,tool,tool,
54.93,61.69,this is the thing that's going to be letting u the neon light and i made sure that it was long enough using a heat gun,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
63.94,69.89,i i thought maybe if i like strung a piece of string through the pipe it would be easier to pull the l wire through afterwards,justification,justification,justification,
70.56,71.98,so that was my reason behind that,justification,justification,justification,
74.62,81.96,when bending the pipe it's easiest if you heat it up right on the side that you're going to be sending it in to,instruction,instruction,instruction,
81.97,83.79,first thing we did is we worked on a little hand,instruction,instruction,instruction,
92.14,98.25,next i'm going to like the black art which is the connecting part and it like bends in kind of how you see it there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
98.3,99.25,so that's what i did,instruction,instruction,instruction,
100.52,104.74,and then it's just a whole lot of marking and bending it to fit your drawing,instruction,instruction,instruction,
112.57,116.96,so this took me a while to figure out kind of the way to do this and i had to keep on,context,context,context,
116.97,121.06,like cutting off pieces of the pipe to try again and i cough so much that was able to finish,context,context,context,
121.07,121.98,so i had to start over,context,context,context,
123.28,129.99,and it was a good thing because i tried to pull the el wire through with it bent and that was impossible,context,context,context,
130,134.97,so we're going to try pulling the el wire through when it's straight and heating up with the el wire inside,instruction,instruction,instruction,
135.88,137.83,and that's what it seemed to work,effect,justification,effect,
139.04,150.93,so same thing just marking it heating it up on the one side the side that's going to be bending in and check and make sure it fit,instruction,instruction,instruction,
150.99,155.71,we're checking to make sure that it's right bending it checking it bending it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
157.41,158.97,just a whole lot of bending,context,instruction,context,
161.11,161.95,nice one,side note,status,side note,
186.13,196.28,and until you get right here i thought it looked pretty cool to get to the markings,status,status,status,
196.29,198.87,i just took like some solvent and a tissue and wipe those off,instruction,instruction,instruction,
206.16,209.47,you can also cut off all the excess pull wire and that's fine,instruction,instruction,instruction,
209.48,210.09,it's still works,instruction,instruction,instruction,
210.75,213.85,on the other side though i need to get rid of that extra pipe,instruction,instruction,instruction,
213.89,216.86,but i didn't want to cut the el wire there because then it wouldn't be connected,justification,justification,justification,
217.17,223.96,so i ended up doing was i took a rotary tool and justice cut the pipe so i could get the low wire out,instruction,instruction,instruction,
226,226.77,nice one,side note,status,side note,
228.22,242.94,so after that i took some more white transparent spray paint put on a mask and and just i sprayed that and then we'll see you,instruction,instruction,instruction,
244.73,248.96,i didn't have like the best coating so you can see all like the weird mistakes,status,status,status,
250.61,253.84,but moving on next to paint the little connectors,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
253.85,262.26,i use a big brush with just like black acrylic paint and this should block the light on those parts that i don't want light to show through,tool specification,instruction,instruction,
263.07,270.16,so use the big brush and then i use the small brush for like the small little details or for like the places that are hard to reach,tool specification,instruction,instruction,
277.63,283.33,i then spray painted the excess cord on the other side with black spray paint and it looks good,instruction,instruction,instruction,
286.84,299.11,when we issue is the little transformer box thing that makes like this really obnoxious buzzing sound so i thought maybe if i covered with cloth and electrical tape that was like muffled the the buzz,instruction,context,instruction,
299.47,307.51,but no matter how much i put i saw the bus so i think i'm just gonna like hang the light up next to the plant and plant that into the dirt,instruction,instruction,instruction,
307.52,308.19,i don't know,side note,side note,side note,
308.26,309.46,yeah that might work,side note,side note,side note,
309.47,310.11,we'll see,side note,side note,side note,

351.21,352.28,something about this project,reflection,reflection,reflection,
352.29,353.48,i would have changed guys,reflection,reflection,reflection,
353.55,357.22,i probably would have made those letters bigger and it's really hard to do those little bands,reflection,reflection,reflection,
357.61,360.6,and the thing is that those letters took six feet of pipe,reflection,reflection,reflection,
360.83,362.7,so i'll probably just use double the amount of pipe,reflection,reflection,reflection,
364,366.87,and i actually kind of liked it before i spray painted it better,reflection,reflection,reflection,
366.92,369.41,but whatever,reflection,closing,closing,
369.72,370.31,thanks guys,closing,closing,closing,
