0.86,2.28,hi ryan dotson here today,opening,opening,opening,
2.29,10.53,we're going to talk about trapping in the wilderness specifically in survival situations and there's a lot of different trap options that you have available to try and catch yourself a meal,context,goal,goal,
10.96,12.82,there are pit traps that you can dig,context,goal,goal,
12.83,18.64,there are a deadfall traps you can build but they take a lot of calories and they're not as efficient as snare traps,goal,goal,goal,
26.32,33.85,stair traps are designed to use cordage to catch your animal and and hold it in place until you can come over and and dispatch of it,context,context,context,
34.04,41.31,and so the best option is to actually have a manufactured snare which is going to be reinforced cable,context,context,context,
41.32,47.43,it's going to be an eyelid at the end that's designed to be stronger that can actually hold animals as big as coyotes,context,context,context,
47.52,49.54,so that's your best option,context,context,context,
49.61,57.27,unfortunately in survival situations you rarely have that with you and so what we're looking at using in most cases is some kind of cordage,context,context,context,
57.36,65.75,so i'm using just a orange five fifty paracord today so it's visible and you can see how i tied the snare,tool,tool,tool,
66.17,71.29,i prefer using copper wire and i don't know how well you can see this,tool,tool,tool,
71.36,81.5,part of the reason why i like using copper wire is because it is hard to see the animals are not going to be able to see it nearly as easily and so they're more likely to walk into your trap and you're using wire,context,context,context,
81.59,94.66,the other thing is you can bend and shape this wire however you like and so it gives you a lot of options as far as positioning your snare that you don't have with cordage that that doesn't have that stiffness to it,context,context,context,
94.71,104.17,and the other thing is that when you're tying wire versus cordage you don't actually have to necessarily tie anything,context,context,context,
104.22,111.6,you could just twist it like a bread tie and in a lot of cases that's going to be strong enough to hold when you're dealing with an animal,context,context,context,
111.75,114.26,so those are the advantages that i like,context,context,context,
115.11,117.92,you know the spool that i use cost me,tool,tool,tool,
117.93,119.16,i think about six bucks,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
119.88,124.01,it's a little spool of wire like that and i've been using it over and over and over again,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
124.18,126.8,i always carry this with me if it all possible,context,context,context,
127.26,131.53,now as far as actually tying a snare it's really pretty simple,bridge,bridge,bridge,
132.28,150.07,you're going to want to tie a simple overhand knot in the end and then the key to making sure that it does not slip back open once the animal gets caught is you're going to overlap it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
150.41,161.66,so if you can see how i i've overlapped right there and then go through the you're two new eyelets,instruction,instruction,instruction,
162.98,164.2,have to create your snare,instruction,instruction,instruction,
164.27,170.44,if you can see how that looks right there that's going to give you twice as much tension on the line,status,status,status,
170.51,175.1,to where when you catch an animal in here it's not going to want to come loose,status,status,status,
175.19,176.68,that is pretty tight right there,status,status,status,
176.69,180.49,so that's how you want to tie your snares whenever you're using cordage,context,context,context,
180.5,185.02,now unless i'm trying to catch something big i'm probably not going to use the full fifty five,context,context,context,
185.03,186.18,fifty paracord,context,context,context,
186.27,194.75,this has a bunch of smaller strands in the middle there that you can pull out and each of those strands is strong enough to catch an animal like a rabbit,context,context,context,
195.71,202.32,so you can actually make seven or eight different snares out of a piece of this size and that gets you to be as efficient as possible,context,context,context,
202.91,216.47,so moving back over to the wire here all we're gonna do is make an eyelet vbn back through the island,instruction,instruction,instruction,
217.18,226.61,and because the wire retains its shape that much better you really don't have to worry about having the the additional tension,effect,justification,effect,
226.62,232.49,because what's going to happen is as this tightens down it's not going to want to bend and come loose,effect,effect,effect,
232.5,234.55,it's going to stay in place,effect,effect,effect,
234.64,237.69,and so that's one of the reasons i really like using this wire,side note,justification,justification,
237.74,243.61,now as far as how you're going to attach this snare and and actually implement it in the wild,context,context,subgoal,
243.73,248.75,one of the easiest things to do is just take this end right here and tie it on to something stationary,context,instruction,instruction,
248.76,253.41,whether that be a stake in the ground or the base of a tree or anything like that,context,instruction,instruction,
253.48,,and then you could position this in front of a game trail just slightly up off the ground,context,instruction,instruction,
,264.35,so that as an animal comes through here they're going to walk through and get their head caught in the snare,context,context,context,
264.48,267.29,and that's the the quickest and easiest way to use this,context,context,context,
267.44,269.33,another option that i use all the time,context,context,context,
269.34,273.35,if i'm in a wooded area where i know there's squirrels is called a squirrel pole,context,instruction,context,
273.44,283.34,now girls are fairly lazy if they have a tree that they want to climb and they have the option of climbing up another pole that's resting against it,context,context,context,
283.41,285.36,or going straight up and down there,context,context,context,
285.37,289.88,always going to take that forty five degree angle because it just requires less energy,context,tip,context,
290.03,298.26,so by leaning a pole up against the tree and putting snares on that pole you give yourself a very good opportunity to catch that squirrel,context,tip,context,
298.35,303.84,so i'm going to go take this and i'm going to show you how i attach it to a squirrel pole to be able to catch squirrels in that manner,bridge,bridge,bridge,
312.76,317.91,ok so you can see that we've got these snares attached and because of the nature of the wire,status,status,status,
317.92,322.67,i'm able to position them so they're just kind of floating over the squirrel pole here,status,status,status,
322.72,326.49,so if we want to attach a third one i usually like three or four of these on here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
326.64,336.93,we just twist it a few times right there spin this down around to the backside and then put it up over top here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
337,340.89,and as a squirrel goes up here he's gonna catch on one of these he's gonna fall,context,context,context,
340.9,342.23,and he's gonna hang himself,context,context,context,
342.3,343.31,and we got to lunch,context,context,context,
351.33,353.5,ok so this is a spring snare where,status,status,status,
353.51,361.06,i've actually used a spring pole here along with some portage and a mechanism down here to hold it in place,context,context,context,
361.07,366.86,so this is just a steak and a stick right here with the snare attached on the end,context,context,context,
367.26,369.17,and so all i have to do it,context,context,context,
370.56,378.07,place this under my place the snare in place it wherever i want it and then as the animal comes along,context,context,context,
379.51,382.66,that will spring up and catch the so,context,context,context,
382.83,385.58,those are a few snare options for you to help you get food in the wild,closing,closing,closing,
385.64,386.32,i'm ryan dotson,closing,closing,closing,
386.33,387.1,thanks for watching,closing,closing,closing,
