0.56,5.19,so i'm kind of afraid of customized just because i was sharpening on on on the wheels,side note,side note,side note,
5.24,9.29,as i was sharpening the knife snapped and a piece of it flew by,side note,side note,side note,
9.3,11.69,my face caught my cheek just slightly,side note,side note,side note,
11.7,13.01,blood started dripping down,side note,side note,side note,
13.08,14.47,i went to my my manager,side note,side note,side note,
14.48,16.51,i was like i'm not sharpening anymore today,side note,side note,side note,
16.52,19.33,i need i need my mental health break right now,side note,side note,side note,
24.16,30.07,hello my name is vincent and we're here at korean japanese trading and,opening,opening,opening,
,,today we're going to be doing some basic knife sharpening,goal,goal,goal,
30.12,32.75,we're going to be using waterstones or wet stones,tool,tool,tool,
32.76,41.99,this is the way that knives having sharpened in japan for many many years and it's become a very popular way of sharpening in the cullinary industry around the world,context,tool specification,,
42.06,49.83,a stone is grinding metal off to create a new edge whereas a honing steel is used to realign your edge and provide a temporary fix,context,tool specification,,
52.75,56.14,and i just want to go through the different water stones that are available,context,tool specification,,
56.19,59.82,so the first group are what i consider medium stones,context,tool specification,,
59.89,64.24,now medium stones range from around eight hundred grit to two thousand grit,context,tool specification,,
64.29,67.32,i think the one thousand is the best all around stone,context,tool specification,,
67.37,72.42,if you have a good knife it's really recommended to get a good quality stone that matches your knife,context,tool specification,,
72.47,76.68,we're going to soak these stone and water for about fifteen to twenty minutes prior to use,context,instruction,,
77.25,82.08,the last group of stones i got are considered finishing or fine stones,context,tool specification,,
82.09,83.8,these start at around three thousand,context,tool specification,,
84.4,88.7,this one is an eight thousand but i've seen fifteen or even thirty thousand grit stones,context,tool specification,,
89.34,94.03,so now that we got through all the stones we can go ahead and start talking about knife sharpening,bridge,bridge,bridge,
94.1,99.45,so the first thing that's very important is to make sure you know what kind of knife you're gonna be sharpening,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
99.46,102.43,specifically you want to know the ratio of the bevel,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
102.44,108.81,i have a japanese style chef knife that's sharpened at a seventy to thirty ratio and i'm right handed,tool,tool,tool,
108.82,114.65,so holding a knife my outer edge or my right side facing down is the dominant side and that's the sign i'm going to sharpen more,instruction,instruction,instruction,
114.66,119.1, so the first one i have here,tool,tool,tool,
119.51,121.04,this is the one thousand grit stone,tool,tool,tool,
121.11,123.01,this is going to do most of the work now,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
123.02,128.14,when i sharpen this knife i like to get in to have it or starting on the backside,instruction,instruction,instruction,
128.15,129.82,that's my left side facing down,instruction,instruction,instruction,
129.87,132.9,when i do this the grip i use my thumb is on the spine,instruction,instruction,instruction,
132.95,137.54,my index finger is on the heel and i like to hold the knife diagonally,instruction,instruction,instruction,
137.61,143.92,this position really allows my wrist to be in control of the angle and really keep it steady,justification,effect,,
143.93,147.46,now the next step is to find the proper angle and this is,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
147.53,149.83,it's probably the most difficult part of sharpening,context,context,context,
149.9,152.81,every single knife has a slightly different angle,context,context,context,
152.86,156.41,the way i do this i lay my knife flat on the stone,instruction,instruction,instruction,
156.52,161.91,i take two fingers and place it half on the stone half on the knife right on the edge,instruction,instruction,instruction,
161.96,168.17,and i'm going to slowly lift my knife up until i feel the edge flush with the stone,instruction,instruction,instruction,
168.22,171.31,but i do have a little trick that makes it a little bit easier,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
171.32,174.23,i take three pennies stack them up and place it on the stone,instruction,instruction,instruction,
174.24,176.73,lay the spine of the knife onto those three pennies,instruction,instruction,instruction,
176.78,179.44,now my edge is flush with a stone,instruction,instruction,instruction,
179.51,182.32,this three pennies is acting as a perfect guideline,context,context,context,
183.78,188.07,now that we found the proper angle and you know how to hold the knife we can start sharpening,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
188.12,193.17,so i'm going to place two fingers right on the tip and press firmly as i pull straight down,instruction,instruction,instruction,
194.15,196.12,let go of pressure as i go up,instruction,instruction,instruction,
196.35,205.02,then i move my fingers slightly over and i work my way down in sections and apply the same amount of pressure in each little sections,instruction,instruction,instruction,
205.09,209.24,now i'm going to repeat this process several times on the backside,instruction,instruction,instruction,
209.39,218.16,now the reason why it's very important to sharpen your knife is because your knife is going to cut the ingredients much easier and it's just going to be that much safer,effect,justification,,
218.21,225.29,after a couple of passes on the backside we're ready to flip over and work on the dominant side of the knife,instruction,instruction,instruction,
225.34,227.37,with this i changed my grip a little bit,instruction,instruction,instruction,
227.38,230.67,my thumb is on the heel and my index finger is on the spine,instruction,instruction,instruction,
230.74,239.67,now just like before i'm gonna hold the knife right around a four o'clock position and use my left fingers to feel for that proper angle,instruction,instruction,instruction,
239.73,242.19,we're working on the dominant side of this knife,context,context,context,
242.24,244.62,if we wanted to use the penny trick,context,context,context,
244.63,248.95,what we're going to do differently is use two pennies rather than the three pennies,context,instruction,,
249.46,254.57,this is going to give us a shallower angle and as you can see just like before that edge,instruction,instruction,instruction,
254.65,256.37,it was nice and flush with the stone,instruction,instruction,instruction,
256.44,259.49,i'm gonna start by sharpening the tip and working my way down,instruction,instruction,instruction,
259.54,262.05,however this time the ad just facing me,instruction,instruction,instruction,
262.12,264.33,so there is one thing i'm gonna do differently,instruction,instruction,instruction,
264.38,269.42,place two fingers right on the tip and press firmly as i push straight up,instruction,instruction,instruction,
269.7,274.87,let go when i come down and repeat then move my finger slightly over,instruction,instruction,instruction,
275.12,279.33,and just like before i'm working my way down the knife in sections,instruction,instruction,instruction,
279.52,286,now we're working on the dominant side of this knife which means we're going to work on the side a lot longer,context,context,context,
286.05,293.68,and eventually there comes a point where that edge will fold over and cause a ridge or what we call a burr to form,context,context,context,
293.75,300.35,the whole point of this sharpening is to get a bur evenly from the heel all the way to the tip,context,context,context,
300.39,306.2,when you're using a water stone you're going to start to see this mud or sediment build up,context,context,context,
306.57,311.04,this is metal that's being taken off of your knife so that means your stone is working properly,context,context,context,
311.09,317.1,but try to keep as much of that sediment on there and use it as you are sharpening your knife,instruction,instruction,instruction,
318.83,329.59,and now that i'm checking for a bird and i feel it all along the edge evenly i'm done with my first stone and i can move on to my finishing or polishing stone,instruction,instruction,instruction,
329.84,336.65,i don't have them soaking i actually have them dry,context,instruction,,
,,finishing stones can be a little bit more delicate if you leave them in water for too long,,justification,,
336.66,337.95,they can actually crack,context,justification,,
338.04,339.19,as i'm sharpening,context,justification,,
339.26,348.39,i'm just constantly adding water but once i'm done i'm going to make sure i pad it dry and set it aside to air dry fully before i put it away,context,instruction,,
349.8,355.9,so just like before i'm going to start on the back fuel for the proper angle and from the tip,instruction,instruction,instruction,
355.94,363.15,i work my way down the knife in sections but this time i'm being very careful not to press too hard,instruction,instruction,instruction,
363.22,371.04,and even though i'm not pressing very hard at all you can see all this sediment starting to build up,status,effect,,
371.11,376.6,which means the stone is doing all the work and this is actually going to refine the edge make it smoother,context,effect,,
376.67,382.91,make it sharper same thing on the other side and work from the tip all the way down in sections to the heel,instruction,instruction,instruction,
383.31,391.38,now when you're using a polishing or finishing stone the longer you work on the stone the more reflective and polished that edge will become,context,context,context,
391.65,395.21,just along the edge it's going to look almost like a mirror finish,context,context,context,
395.65,398.93,for me that usually takes maybe five for ten minutes,context,context,context,
399.91,404.8,now once you're happy with the polish on your knife you've made sure that there's no burs remaining,instruction,instruction,instruction,
404.92,407.74,we're gonna take a piece of paper and test the knife,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
408.17,411.15,there's very little resistance as i push the knife through,status,status,status,
411.21,418.5,make sure you test the whole length of your knife so you always want to start at the heel all the way to that tip,instruction,instruction,instruction,
418.55,422.04,if there's a dull spot this paper is going to drag,context,context,context,
422.27,425.74,if there's any chips or burrs remaining it's just going to snag,context,context,context,
425.79,428.88,the thinner the paper the better of a test it is for your knife,context,tool specification,,
428.93,429.86,challenge yourself,instruction,instruction,instruction,
429.94,433.45,use thinner paper and if you can cut through that your knife is going to be pristine,instruction,instruction,instruction,
433.83,437.38,now the last thing i want to get into is this little guy right here,tool,bridge,,
437.43,439.6,this is called a stone fixer,tool ,tool,,
439.67,447.22,every single stone as you use it will eventually start to wear down and this flat surface will start to bowl,context,context,context,
447.33,454.56,so it's very important to use a stone fixer to resurface your stone work the surface as evenly as possible,instruction,instruction,instruction,
454.61,458.94,and make sure that you have a nice and flat surface to work on,instruction,instruction,instruction,
459.57,460.58,take care of your night,closing,closing,closing,
460.65,461.38,how do you take care of them,closing,closing,closing,
461.39,462.69,they'll last a long time,closing,closing,closing,
466.33,466.64,no no,closing,closing,closing,
