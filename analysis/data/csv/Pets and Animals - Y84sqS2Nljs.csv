18.09,24.18,once i disassemble the huge cage behind me i'm going to only be using the double critter nation,motivation,motivation,motivation,
24.23,26.72,so i'm going to be disassembling the third unit,motivation,motivation,motivation,
26.79,33.89,which means that when i need to put the rats in something for like the cage cleaning time i won't have that option anymore,motivation,motivation,motivation,
34,39.95,so what i'm going to do instead is use this cage here for that cage cleaning extra cage,motivation,motivation,motivation,
40.02,42.41,and i think that's going to work really well with my rats,motivation,motivation,motivation,
42.56,47.97,so anyways you can see that i've gotten started by putting some yesterday's news betting inside the cage,instruction,instruction,instruction,
48.02,56.93,and the main reason i've only put a tiny bit in here is because well honestly i didn't want to open a new bag and this was all i had left in my previous bag,justification,justification,justification,
56.98,59.19,so we're just going to work with this for now,status,instruction,context,
59.28,68.84,so the first thing i'm going to do is just decorate the bottom and i've decided that i'm going to be putting in a wheel just because i know my younger girls really like them,instruction,instruction,instruction,

74,82.49,the next thing i'm going to put in there is some sort of hide and i've decided i'm going to use this pink igloo just because it kind of fits perfectly in this spot,instruction,instruction,instruction,
82.72,85.61,and i'm also going to be using this food dish right above it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
86.74,91.39,the next thing i decided to put inside is just this cardboard tube,tool,tool,tool,

99.03,101.14,so that's basically the bottom of the cage,status,status,status,
101.21,107.08,now i'm going to go ahead and put on the top so that i can start attaching things to the wire part of the cage,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
108.72,110.45,so so here we go,context,context,context,
115.6,121.65,ok so you can see that i've now put on the wire part of the cage and i'm planning on hanging up stuff in it,status,status,status,
121.66,125.05,just kind of by opening this top door's,status,status,status,
125.06,130.07,not really sure how well that's going to work just because this door is kind of small,status,status,status,
130.08,137.22,but we'll see how that goes and i'm going to be putting in some of my favorite things,status,status,status,
137.23,153.18,so here i have this little shelf thing from lowes and i've just taken the liberty of binder clipping on some belt and actually i have a second one right here and i'm going to be connecting them'cause that's a cool thing,tool,tool,tool,
154.35,161.72,these shelves so like that and i'm going to be hanging this up in the cage,instruction,instruction,instruction,

165.19,166.1,ohb there we go,side note,side note,side note,
166.83,173.28,and i'm going to be hanging this up in the cage like a mini shelf so we'll see how that works,context,context,context,
175.63,176.89,ok whoops,side note,side note,side note,
177.72,184.1,ok so now i finished with the shelving and i've decided i want to put in some different shelving here,status,subgoal,subgoal,
184.16,189.43,so i'm going to be slipping this inside the cage and trying to hang it up again,tool,instruction,instruction,
189.44,194.25,this comes from lowes and it has some place inside for comfort,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,

209.07,215.79,and they think i'm going to be putting this tube here into the basket just to add some variety of like that,tool,tool,tool,
216.52,220.47,i know cream likes to sleep in too so i think that's going to be a big hit,side note,side note,side note,
220.9,224.21,and honestly i'm not sure what else i can put in the cage,side note,side note,side note,
224.22,234.47,i mean for some reason this upper area feels a bit empty but i do need somewhere to put water bottles and i'm thinking that might be the area that i'll do it,context,context,context,
234.9,239.05,so i'm going to go ahead and put those in and we'll see how it turns out,bridge,bridge,bridge,
239.54,243.99,ok so now you can see that i've added the water bottles here and i think that works really well,status,status,status,
