53.96,61.23,i'm just going to take the spoolie and as you can see it brushes all the hairs upward and they stay like that,effect,instruction,,
63.3,74.24,kind of push these ones this way to even make them look even more bushy so you could see the difference,instruction,instruction,instruction,
74.25,79.56,now look at these brow hairs or reckless out of control and these are all pushed upwards,status,status,status,
79.61,80.8,look nice and full,status,status,status,
80.81,82.56,bushy when they're all pushed up,status,status,status,
82.57,85.86,it does make my eyebrows look thicker because the hairs go all in one direction,status,warning,,
85.87,87.09,it makes them look a little thinner,status,warning,,
87.13,87.9,we don't want that,status,warning,,
87.95,95.5,alright so i'm just sweeping this product through and my brows are kind of crazy right now because i feel like last time i threaded them there were too thin,side note,side note,side note,
95.55,99.24,so i'm trying to grow them out right now looking a little crazy,side note,side note,side note,
99.46,104.23,this is definitely my bad bro over here but we'll fix it in the film and process,status,side note,,

106.95,108.4,it's ok though it's ok,side note,side note,side note,
108.59,112.86,alright so as you can see now that it's all brushed out i have a lot of sparseness in my brows,status,status,status,
112.87,118.62,what i'm going to do first is focus on the more sparse areas and create heavy hairline strokes,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
118.67,121.04,strokes and use the benefit,tool,tool,tool,
121.05,126.48,kubrow in number four and this is just kind of like a brow pomade and i just use the brush it comes with,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,

129.87,130.42,boom,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
130.47,133.94,i feel like the way you dip this into the product is pretty important,context,context,context,
134,139.5,i find that when i want to make hair like strokes i really focus on dipping the tip of the brush in,context,justification,,
139.51,141,so this part right here,context,status,,
141.05,146.03,you just really want to make sure to get a lot of product there because that's really what i'm using to do,context,instruction,,
146.04,149.3,the hair like strokes lay it all flat on the tip,instruction,instruction,instruction,
149.31,150.58,put a lot of product as well,instruction,instruction,instruction,
150.81,167.31,i'm going to start right here laying down the point of the brush first and then creating the hair like strokes someone a little far,instruction,instruction,instruction,
167.32,167.68,it's ok,instruction,instruction,instruction,
167.69,170.92,you could always wipe it off so i like to fill in the really sparse areas first,tip,tip,tip,
170.93,175.07,that way i can get a grasp of how much product i really need and the rest of my brows,tip,tip,tip,
175.08,181.75,sometimes you don't really need that much product where you have more hairs but you add it anyways just because you feel like you need to add it everywhere,tip,tip,tip,
181.76,182.95,but you don't always need to,tip,tip,tip,
182.96,187.29,so it's good to get an idea of what your shape would be like if those sparse areas were,tip,tip,tip,
187.3,188.99,you know not so sparse,tip,tip,tip,
189,192.97,and it's important to note that i'm using a really really light hand,context,instruction,,
193.04,194.77,when i'm applying these strokes,context,instruction,,
194.82,197.41,i'm not adding lot of pressure,context,instruction,,
197.42,199.21,i want to keep them really light,context,instruction,,
200.77,205.28,and if you make one that might be a little too harsh you could always soften it up later,context,justification,,
205.29,207.09,so don't worry i do it all the time,context,side note,,
207.1,212.54,it's not a problem taking my spoolie and just running it through the browse,instruction,instruction,instruction,
212.61,221.02,so now i'm gonna take a clean ish concealer brush and just clean up the edges of the strokes that i just made,instruction,instruction,instruction,
221.03,225.9,if i have any mistakes or if you know you want to clean up the brow shape make it smaller,instruction,instruction,instruction,
225.91,228.62,so this is like the base of our our brow hairs,status,status,status,
228.69,231.45,we kind of gave the illusion that we have some,status,status,status,
231.52,232.13,well here's there,status,status,status,
232.14,234.28,but now we have to kind of soften it and blend it all out,status,context,,
234.29,235.94,katie's texting me right now,side note,side note,side note,
235.95,236.76,this bitch,side note,side note,side note,

242.77,244.22,i mean not much is different right now,side note,side note,side note,
244.23,246.28,i still got those hairs going on strong,side note,side note,side note,
246.29,247.4,but my highlight though,side note,side note,side note,
247.47,247.98,popping,side note,side note,side note,
247.99,252.28,you're so rude to me going back into the pomade,side note,side note,side note,
252.33,262.06,i'm just going to even lighter than the first time try to blur out any hairs that maybe look a little too harsh and start to work on the shape,instruction,instruction,instruction,
262.13,267.06,so once you have the hair like texture you can kind of shape the brows a little bit more so i could see that,instruction,instruction,instruction,
267.07,269.38,there's a little discrepancy right here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
269.42,281.58,i'm just going to go in and try to blur that out and i'm not adding a lot of product,instruction,instruction,instruction,
281.59,284.77,it's very little product to get the shape see,instruction,instruction,instruction,
284.78,285.56,they're very light,status,status,status,
285.57,292.64,still we're in a darken them up but i need to get the shape with just a little bit of product because i don't want it to look too harsh like i've drawn on the brows,instruction,instruction,instruction,
292.71,297.18,we're going to kind of go into the front of the brows because i do have some sparseness here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
297.23,303.2,as you can see there's a little sparseness in this area so this is even lighter of a touch because it's the front of your brows,justification,instruction,,
303.21,306.87,you don't want to look too crazy so just light strokes upwards,instruction,instruction,instruction,
312.85,313.94,i kind of messed up there,status,status,status,
314.01,317.57,not gonna lie to you guys things happen ok if you mess up just wipe it off,side note,side note,side note,
317.58,318.47,let's keep it pushing,side note,bridge,,
324.18,325.93,strokes were a whisper,instruction,instruction,instruction,
325.98,329.65,that's how light you want to apply it in that section,instruction,instruction,instruction,
329.7,334.22,see we've got the bushiness going on in some,status,status,status,
334.23,335.68,hair growth is happening here,status,status,status,
339.25,344.95,you can continue to add more strokes in any of the sparse areas,instruction,instruction,instruction,
344.96,348.27,i haven't put a lot of product here yet because that's where i have the most hair,context,context,context,
348.28,355.01,so now i'm going to go in and justice add some hair like strokes in that area so that the color is all the same across the brow,instruction,instruction,instruction,
355.06,360.57,because this product is a little bit warmer than my brows i want to make sure it all blends together,justification,justification,,
360.62,366.48,so let's lightly go through and add some of that product,instruction,instruction,instruction,
366.49,367.22,not a lot,instruction,instruction,instruction,
367.28,371.42,so now i'm just going in and rounding out the arch,instruction,instruction,instruction,
371.47,377.42,now that the majority of my brow has hair like strokes and it all looks a little bit more like natural hairs,status,status,status,
377.43,386.18,i can use the brush to round out the arch and it'll still look pretty natural because it's a very little part of the brow that i'm just rounding out here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
391.8,392.35,look at that,status,status,status,
392.42,394.29,it looks like we have hairs,status,status,status,
394.34,397.95,when we don't look at this bro look at this brow,status,status,status,
398,400.84,this sprow this sprow hot mass,status,status,status,
407.62,409.21,i was trying to think of a word,status,status,status,
409.22,410.77,so this is the finished brow look,outcome,outcome,outcome,
410.78,412.85,i went ahead and did the other side,outcome,outcome,outcome,
412.86,415.51,same exact technique as the side that i just showed you guys,outcome,outcome,outcome,
415.52,416.77,actually a pretty easy,reflection,reflection,reflection,
416.84,422.69,the trick is to make sure to get the hair like strokes in first before you shape the brow up and that's it,reflection,reflection,reflection,
422.7,428.34,it's going to look like you have growth in places that maybe you don't have growth because i don't know,reflection,reflection,reflection,
428.35,431.81,you plucked them in eighth grade or you just don't have natural brow hairs like i thought,reflection,reflection,reflection,
431.82,432.58,i plucked all my hairs,side note,side note,side note,
432.59,436.86,but looking back at my baby photos i don't think i ever really had a lot of hair in this area,side note,side note,side note,
436.87,438.38,so technique really works for me,reflection,reflection,reflection,
438.39,439.56,that's it for this video,closing,closing,closing,
