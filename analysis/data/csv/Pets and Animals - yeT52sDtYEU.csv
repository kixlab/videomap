1.62,7.39,hello my name is katie rushworth and ,opening,opening,opening,
7.46,8.09,today i'm going to show you how to make a pond in a pot,goal,goal,goal,
12.82,18.75,and pond in a pot is a concept that i came up with because water is essential in the garden,motivation,motivation,motivation,
18.76,20.82,especially if you want to attract wildlife,motivation,motivation,motivation,
20.86,24.21,but not everybody has the space for a huge pond,motivation,motivation,motivation,
24.42,26.53,one can be created in this though,motivation,motivation,motivation,
26.58,36.53,believe it or not this is just a standard terracotta glazed container and the first thing we need to do is deal with this hole in the bottom of the pot,tool,tool,tool,
37.12,44.46,and to do that i'm going to use just the standard pebble umm and some bathroom sealant,tool,tool,tool,
48.12,56.91,now we were really generous with this because we want a really tight seal so no water can escape,instruction,instruction,instruction,
58.06,62.55,it's also worth's when you're buying your container,instruction,instruction,instruction,
63.87,72.15,checking the actually only has one drainage hole because if you had to fill i'll cover five or six drainage holes in the bottom,instruction,instruction,instruction,
74.56,76.19,it would make the job a little bit trickier,instruction,warning,justification,
76.26,76.75,o k,bridge,bridge,bridge,
77.78,81.37,so so that is,status,status,status,
81.38,83.52,my wife bathroom sealant,status,status,status,
86.95,88.4,now my ceiling is dry,status,status,status,
88.47,99.05,i'm going to add some more pebbles to the bottom and this is because i really want to have a little ledge that if any wildlife falls into,instruction,instruction,instruction,
99.17,102.44,it can still get out the sides because this is quite a deep pot,justification,justification,justification,
106.05,116.89,and then i'm going to add more gravel to the bottom and this is really is for any wildlife that was to find a home in here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
118.86,123.15,as well as giving me that little bit of extra height to support the plants,effect,effect,effect,
130.29,132.7,ok ok and now for my plants,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
134.47,137.3,now i've got a selection here,tool,tool,tool,
137.37,139.06,this is one of my favourites,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
139.25,146.51,little bit damaged this one but it's a marsh marigold and in the spring it has these brilliant bright yellow flowers,tool,tool,tool,
146.52,149.12,they're stunning so i'm definitely want to put that in,instruction,instruction,instruction,
149.13,156.17,and it kind of creates a lovely mound of plant that will kind of tumble over the edge so we're definitely having one of those,effect,effect,effect,
159.09,162.63,and then the next one is water mint and this is lovely,tool,tool,tool,
162.64,168.37,it gets a really pretty purple flower on and you can't eat this version but it smells just like mint,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
168.38,170.34,it's lovely so that will go in,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
172.49,180.93,and the nice thing about using it the plants is again it's all about creating an environment habitat that wildlife are happy to visit,context,context,context,
181.02,187.12,and with amy paul no matter how big or small it's really good to have at least one third of the pond,context,context,context,
187.13,196.75,the surface of the pond covered with foliage and that creates shade for any fish or frogs or nuts that will be in there and they'll be much happier in that kind of environment,context,context,context,
200.63,202.14,a little bit of form,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
203.5,204.5,this is grass,tool,tool,tool,
205.38,208.07,i might stop those two around actually put a bit of high at the back,instruction,instruction,instruction,
208.08,211.13,i think on this at the front,instruction,instruction,instruction,
213.44,220.81,now in a normal pond you could plant these in pockets of soil but as this is only a small container,context,context,context,
220.82,225.47,i don't want them to come too invasive and take over so they're staying in their little containers,context,context,context,
228.25,229.83,no my pants are place,status,status,status,
231.28,232.75,i think i might leave that one out,instruction,instruction,instruction,
232.76,235.99,as lovely as it is i think it would be overkill,instruction,instruction,instruction,
236.34,238.3,now i'm going to fill it up with rainwater,instruction,instruction,instruction,
238.31,248.45,you can use tap water if you like but it will take a couple of days to settle and the wildlife certainly won't be enthusiastic about tap water,tool (multiple),tool (multiple),tool (multiple),
248.46,255.31,so i'm going to use rain water and then hopefully the wildlife will met themselves at home an awful lot quicker,instruction,instruction,instruction,
261.56,266.7,are these plants are all meant to be grown submerged in water like this,context,context,context,
267.67,271.94,they're called marginal plants and they will live very happily in here,context,context,context,
273.15,277.58,if you place it somewhere sunny it might have evaporate a little and we'll need topping up,instruction,context,context,
277.73,282.47,but apart from that it's actually no maintenance whatsoever,instruction,context,context,
284,285.59,i managed to squeeze that final plant in,status,status,status,
285.6,289.73,after all it was too nice to leave out and that's it,status,status,status,
289.74,291.22,finished and in situ,outcome,outcome,outcome,
291.3,296.45,after a couple of days i should settle and become crystal clear and i'm really pleased with it,outcome,outcome,outcome,
