0.61,6.5,hey everyone it's steve spangler from the spangler effect and another really cool demonstration from our science archive,opening,opening,opening,
6.57,14.04,i want to show you how to make a fire tornado originally taught to me by a wonderful guy by the name of bob becker out of kirkwood missouri,goal,goal,goal,
14.11,16.34,he was on a lecture series and and showed it,motivation,motivation,motivation,
16.35,22.06,i'm going to show you a little twist in kind of how we brought it to something that may even be easier for you to make,goal,goal,goal,
22.15,25.68,the first question was this was what would happen if you spin fire,context,context,context,
25.75,30.25,so the little setup that i have here is a crucible on this board and there is,tool,tool,tool,
30.6,38.33,there are these little pieces of sponge that i have soaked in lighter fluid so a little bit of lighter fluid on those,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
38.44,40.45,and i like to use the lighter fluid,tool,tool,tool,
40.46,46.7,i know there's an inclination if you're a demonstrator to want to use ethanol and color it and whatever else,tool (multiple),tool,tool (multiple),
46.71,47.67,and that's fine,tool (multiple),tool,tool (multiple),
47.68,49.99,but it really is very effective this way,tip,tool specification,tip,
50,53.95,and that fire kind of works its way up and i think you'll like it,tip,tool specification,tip,
53.96,55.37,so try it with a lighter fluid,tip,tool specification,tip,
55.44,57.63,this lazy susan right,tool,tool,tool,
57.64,60.22,so it's our little and it's been through the war in back,side note,side note,side note,
60.23,61.01,there's no question,side note,side note,side note,
61.08,61.24,now,side note,side note,side note,
61.25,63.98,you can see the fire and burn marks and everything,side note,side note,side note,
63.99,64.28,all right,bridge,bridge,bridge,
64.29,65.18,so here we go,bridge,bridge,bridge,
65.27,69.3,as always if you're doing anything with fire take all this into the proper safety precautions,instruction,instruction,instruction,
69.35,70.94,fire extinguisher close by,instruction,instruction,instruction,
71.03,73.8,the question was what would happen if you spun the fire,context,context,context,
73.85,79.64,so when we light it like this and we spin nothing very exciting happens at all,status,status,status,
79.71,80.94,it just spins,status,status,status,
80.99,86.46,now we know that hot air rises and so that flame of course dances upward,context,context,context,
86.51,90.48,but we wanted to simulate what happens when the air whips through,context,context,context,
90.49,95.05,for example in a forest fire the air whips through this these trees,context,context,context,
95.13,99.26,and as it whips through the trees you've got some angular momentum going on,context,context,context,
99.33,105.78,and so as it starts to work its way through what happens to that air that surrounds the fire and how does it affect the fire,context,context,context,
105.83,112.1,so this is the the tubing or the little screen that i wanted to show you that was originally shown to me,tool,tool,tool,
112.17,116.28,this is just replacement wire or replacement screen found at the hardware store,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
116.33,119.8,you can kind of see that it's all been seamed together here as well,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
119.89,125.72,alright so this is a little top heavy kind of harder to spin,context,context,context,
125.81,128.12,that's where we had rods that came up this way,context,context,context,
128.13,129.34,and you can kind of see why,context,context,context,
129.35,131.42,we were looking for something else to be able to do with it,context,context,context,
131.49,133.4,but i wanted to show you at least the original,context,context,context,
133.47,135.14,so this sits here like this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
135.21,139.71,and so now as you spin watch what happens as you spin it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
139.72,141.15,now that's great,side note,side note,side note,
141.22,148.77,it kind of picks up the the fire starts to dance a little bit and you start to get this fire tornado,status,status,status,
149.22,150.88,ohh that's pretty good that's it,status,status,status,
150.89,151.93,is looking pretty good,status,status,status,
152,166.13,and on a new segment that i did years ago it's where we took and actually put a balloon filled with hydrogen up at the very top with a longer column to see whether or not the fire the flame could dance up and eventually catch that on fire,context,context,context,
166.22,166.85,wake up call,side note,side note,side note,
166.86,167.65,very very cool,side note,side note,side note,
167.7,168.15,all right,side note,side note,side note,
168.32,175.28,so a great setup and kudos to bob becker for a wonderful demonstration kind of showing how a fire tornado works,side note,side note,side note,
175.49,184.32,i wanted to try some other things and as is the case as a science demonstrator we're always looking for different different ways to do the same demonstration,side note,side note,side note,
184.43,188.5,i was at one of those places that we all love of your demonstrator and that is ikea,side note,side note,side note,
188.55,189.94,so take a look at this,side note,side note,side note,
189.95,193.08,how could you beat a lazy susan for seven dollars right,tool,side note,side note,
193.15,196.6,so here is this wonderfully smooth turntable,tool specification,tool,tool,
196.67,200.97,i've seen people do this with phonographs and i've seen him do it with his great molar contraptions,side note,side note,side note,
201.03,205.65,this was just easy to pack and to travel with when i was doing professional development for teachers,side note,side note,side note,
205.69,207.27,so here is our spin,tool,tool,tool,
207.28,207.82,got it,tool,tool,tool,
207.9,211.93,and this is simply a a trash can from ikea as well,tool,tool,tool,
212,214.99,it's got that mesh material and so that's perfect,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
215,222.93,lot sturdier and i could carry other things in it as well so ,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
,,this just has to be positioned in the middle so that it doesn't kind of wobble,instruction,instruction,instruction,
222.94,223.95,that's pretty good,side note,side note,side note,
223.96,224.27,good,side note,side note,side note,
224.36,227.83,and i'm using a petri dish or something to be able to extinguish the fire,tool,tool,tool,
227.88,233.39,but this goes in the top like that and see if we can just look at it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
233.4,234.82,so again here's what's happening,context,context,context,
234.89,241.9,that hot air rises but that spinning piece in the screen is able to catch those molecules and start to spin them,context,context,context,
241.91,247.88,and so it's really that centripetal force or you say the angular momentum of those molecules going around it around,context,context,context,
247.97,252.64,coupled with the rising air that gives you that kind of tornado feel and tornado look,context,context,context,
252.71,253.26,and that,context,context,context,
253.27,254,why,context,context,context,
254.77,259.84,fires can dance from treetop to treetop and spread when the winds whip through,context,context,context,
259.91,262.19,and how dangerous that can be with firefighters,context,context,context,
262.28,264.33,alright so here is here is our flame,status,status,status,
264.34,264.55,watch,context,context,context,
264.56,266.05,what happens when we spin,context,context,context,
266.24,268.13,this makes it really really really,outcome,outcome,outcome,
268.63,271.35,and that tornado is just beautiful isn't it,outcome,outcome,outcome,
271.4,275.23,if you take a look in the very center there you get that vortex in the very middle,outcome,outcome,outcome,
275.38,279.75,that fire vortex is just gorgeous and what a great way to do it,outcome,outcome,outcome,
279.76,285.65,but what a a strong demonstration to be able to show how those flames can jump from treetop to treetop,context,context,context,
285.72,289.45,of course anything that's worth doing is worth overdoing,context,context,context,
289.54,290.87,so in the ellen show we had to make it,side note,side note,side note,
290.96,296.48,it's a little bit bigger with this spinning contraption and sometimes i'll really be honest with you,side note,side note,side note,
296.53,300.06,bigger is not necessarily better for the overall effectiveness,reflection,reflection,reflection,
300.15,311.04,i think this tabletop version is just a wonderful way to be able to demonstrate it but ,reflection,reflection,reflection,
,,it is nice to be able to have the props department at warner brothers help you with something that's just a little bit bigger as well,side note,side note,side note,
311.05,312.18,it's a fire tornado,reflection,reflection,reflection,
312.23,313.7,take all those safety precautions,reflection,reflection,reflection,
