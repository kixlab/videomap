64.59,73.46,time to join them these two breast pieces together making sure that everything is carefully aligned and intact,instruction,instruction,instruction,
73.51,77.06,and when you're done you should have something that looks like this looking,status,status,status,
77.07,78.56,so far in groovy,status,status,status,
78.61,82.18,then i went and took the breast plate and i mocked it up to my mannequin,instruction,instruction,instruction,

90.06,102.81,after i draw all my patterns i glued all my patterns over to some poster board paper and then i transferred them over to some floor mats and some eva that i got from t and t,instruction,instruction,instruction,

152.8,160.19,but yeah this is kind of a tedious process just because there's a whole bunch of pieces on there,context,context,context,
160.24,167.71,but once you get done and she look like that and then go and fill it in with some contact cement and once it's all dried to attack,instruction,instruction,instruction,
167.72,174.4,then you wanna press it together this will give this this really cool bevel looking thingy,instruction,instruction,instruction,
174.56,176.27,yeah what do you think,side note,side note,side note,
176.28,176.59,i think,side note,side note,side note,
176.6,177.91,it's pretty dope,side note,side note,side note,
177.98,185.67,then i moved over to the collar traps strap thingy and i carefully glued those pieces together,instruction,instruction,instruction,
185.74,199.11,i kind of wanted to knock this part out because once i blew the fabric it would make it kind of harder to handle when it's on the table and ,justification,justification,justification,
,,i'm using some pollister style type material that i picked up from walmart,tool,,,
199.16,202.19,it's like sport outdoor fabric now,tool specification,status,,

215.61,217.08,and now that i got everything together,bridge,bridge,bridge,
217.09,222.34,it's time to draw all my patterns where i'm gonna attach these pieces on with some hot glue,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
222.39,228.04,now when i'm attaching these accents to the fabric i like to use high temp hot glue,tip,tool,,
228.31,233.64,this will go into the foam or whatever a whole lot better,tip,justification,,
233.71,242.97,and sometimes i'll use foam that's like floor mat foam where the texture is kind of smooth and the hot glue doesn't really stick with the high temp hot glue,tip,tool,,
243.02,247.33,if you apply enough pressure it will stick really good,tip,instruction,,
247.52,256.27,now i'm going to take the upper chest piece and i'm going to send down the inside where i'm gonna apply some contacts you met now,instruction,instruction,instruction,
256.28,260.27,this will allow it to absorb the contact cement,effect,effect,effect,
260.34,267.67,and then i applied a couple coats onto the fabric and then i'm carefully aligning the pieces together,instruction,instruction,instruction,
267.88,277.41,i could sure that i don't miss this part up because a majority of it is already done and you wanna go halfway through and screw this up,instruction,warning,,
277.58,279.83,but then again it just cost me bro,justification,side note,,
279.92,285.41,and now that i got everything in place i want to make sure all my glue is nice and on there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
285.52,287.93,the last thing you wanna do is your top falling apart,justification,warning,,
288,290.39,yeah that would be quite embarrassing,justification,warning,,
290.68,295.82,but on a serious note though i've never had one of these cosplays come apart on me,status,side note,,
295.86,297.17,at least not like that,status,side note,,
297.24,299.19,move it along to the emblem,subgoal,instruction,,
299.2,302.53,i'm using some two millimeter craft foam,tool,instruction,,
302.58,309.22,it could be three not really sure but i cut it in an inward angle and then flipped it over,instruction,instruction,instruction,
309.23,313.09,and here i got this beveled emblem which looks kind of cool,instruction,status,,
313.18,319.09,place it on the breastplate and mark down all my area so i can apply my contact cement,instruction,instruction,instruction,
319.14,325.73,now you don't want to apply it too much but you just want to put it enough to where it will hold the emblem on there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
325.8,329.17,and then i will use my heat gun to beat form it down,instruction,instruction,instruction,
329.18,334.85,and you can tell right there it's kind of just folds in place exactly how i want it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
334.97,338.46,and then you go back and make sure everything is nice and on there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
338.51,344.52,so far everything is starting to look legit trying to connect it to the back piece which is this,subgoal,instruction,,
344.57,350.9,now you could probably use fabric but i wanted to go ahead and use all foam because why not,tool,tool,tool,
350.97,355.68,now if you happen to pick up one of these templates from me and you're pretty tall person,instruction,context,,
355.79,360.07,then you might want to extend the trap strap area right there,instruction,instruction (optional),,
360.16,372.99,but yeah i already added my velcro and some elastic or elastic with some velcro sewn on to him and this is kind of how it attaches to each other down ,status,status,status,
373.06,374.73,to move along to the bat bat bat belt and that's what i'm going to call it,bridge,side note,,
374.8,384.93,i wouldn't draw all my design on the computer and i went and cut it all out and i want to tape them all together to make sure as long enough to fit around my wife's waist,instruction,instruction,instruction,
385.14,390.52,and yeah i basically use this template as a mock up make sure it was long enough,instruction,instruction,instruction,
390.57,402.94,and then i went in there and cut out my bat belt emblem and decided to go ahead and cut out on some semi thick floor mat eva foam,instruction,instruction,instruction,
403.09,411.25,i did cut the belt out in two sections that way i'm not like using a whole lot of foam to make it,justification,instruction,,
411.31,417.02,i went and took the belt bat bat belt buckle and well that's a tongue twister now,instruction,instruction,instruction,
417.03,427.48,i took the buckle and i cut it with some five millimeter craft foam and an inward angle beveled edge so i can get this really cool effect,instruction,instruction,instruction,
427.53,433.54,which i'm going to end up blowing into the belt buckle so that way it stand out a little bit more,justification,context,,
433.61,436.96,that was the original plan but then i went another route,context,context,context,
437.07,445.14,i had some scrap eva floor mat that thicker kind and i decided to run through my laser and yeah,tool specification,instruction,,
445.15,447.78,it looks a lot cooler so i went that route,justification,justification,justification,
447.89,454.31,then i glued the rest of the belt to it and measured it make sure it fit and it did,justification,instruction,,
454.36,454.59,so,instruction,bridge,,
454.6,460.71,i took a small piece of the pattern for the belt accents i don't know what you would call it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
460.8,467.59,but only needed this one small piece and then i just put it on the belt and drop my lines,instruction,instruction,instruction,
467.6,475.61,and then i repeated this process over until the whole belt was already traced out and then once i was done with that,instruction,instruction,instruction,
475.62,479.59,i took my wood burner with the the tip,tool,instruction,,
479.68,483.07,then i carefully etched in on all the lines,instruction,instruction,instruction,
483.15,494.8,that gave me this really cool bat girl fact without having to cut all the pieces individually and then glue them together because that would have been very long and tedious,effect,effect,effect,
495.19,499.98,but yeah so far so groovy and i'm getting the effect that i'm going for,status,status,status,
500.07,507.6,then i took some elastic so on on some velcro to him and they just go around the waist just like that,instruction,instruction,instruction,
507.67,517.51,and if you're wondering what color i used to the belt and the emblem is called metallic chocolate brown acrylic paint that i picked up from walmart,tool,tool,tool,
