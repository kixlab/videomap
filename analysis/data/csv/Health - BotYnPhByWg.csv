0.87,2.44,and welcome to this product demonstration,goal,goal,goal,
2.45,2.82,video,goal,goal,goal,
2.83,3.92,for the value med,goal,goal,goal,
4.39,6.61,dual head stethoscope packaging,goal,goal,goal,
6.62,12.9,when it comes to it's going to be a flat packed unit in a sealed plastic zip case like this,context,context,context,
12.95,14.52,the one demonstrated in front of you,context,context,context,
14.53,17.78,you've got the chess piece here the tubing,context,context,context,
17.79,19.36,this one's a red one obviously,context,context,context,
19.43,23.02,and on the other side you've got the sprung steel headset,context,context,context,
23.03,25.98,so if we just take this out of the packaging to show you it more clearly,context,instruction,context,
31.65,34.88,ok now first thing to demonstrate to you is the the headset,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
34.97,38,this is a light steel headset with a spring,context,status,status,
38.35,40.02,that's what keeps it in your ears,context,status,status,
40.09,42.6,and the alignment on this is the important thing to look at,context,context,context,
42.61,49.57,if you just pull it slightly apart and align it slightly then you will see that they are slightly pointing forward,context,instruction,context,
49.58,55.17,now some people will want that adjusting slightly so that they're just a little more pointing forward,context,justification,justification,
55.22,63.01,the way to do that is to grip the sprung steel central section and just very gently rotate these,instruction,instruction,instruction,
63.02,65.73,you'll see they will rotate quite easily within the grips,effect,effect,effect,
65.78,73.25,very important not to overdo it though or strain those grips because once the tension on those grips is lost,warning,warning,warning,
73.3,77.24,then it's very difficult even replies to reapply that tension there,warning,warning,warning,
77.25,77.5,you see,status,status,status,
77.51,77.7,i've,status,status,status,
77.71,85.56,i've adjusted that so they're slightly more pointing forward and that's going to give you a far more comfortable fit in the ear canals when you're actually using these units,status,status,status,
85.83,91.32,a lot of complaints but moaning we get about these units is or they're not very comfortable with,context,context,context,
91.33,97.62,feedback we see on them is when they haven't been adjusted properly and they're basically pointing backwards along the ear canal,context,context,context,
97.83,101.8,they have got firm eartips on them rather than soft rubber eartips,context,context,context,
101.81,102.8,those can be replaced,context,tool specification,tool specification,
102.81,104.56,they're simple push fit units,context,tool specification,tool specification,
104.91,105.62,but these units,context,tool specification,tool specification,
105.63,108.76,you gotta remember you're only paying two or three round four plus the delivery,context,tool specification,tool specification,
108.77,115.78,so you're not going to get the comfort or manufacturing quality or a set of soft ear tips supplied with them,context,tool specification,tool specification,
115.83,122.08,so what you've seen me do there is just fit the tubing over the headset part of this unit,instruction,context,late instruction,
122.15,123.36,you push it nice and firmly,instruction,instruction,instruction,
123.37,130.42,it can go right up try and get them certainly match on either side because that's going to reduce the tension on the actual tubing,instruction,instruction,instruction,
130.49,134.04,and then it's just a matter of fitting the dual head,context,context,context,
134.11,138.25,this is a double head chest piece onto the other side of the tube,context,context,context,
138.26,142.01,and now if you have a look at this you've got a standard dual head,context,context,context,
142.08,143.79,this is called a bell and diaphragm model,context,context,context,
143.8,148.23,it's an adult size which is approximately five five and a half centimeters across,context,context,context,
148.52,151.45,this is a diaphragm side with the diaphragm in place,context,context,context,
151.46,152.61,it comes ready constructed,context,context,context,
152.62,157.55,the diaphragm can be removed by removing this diaphragm ring that unscrews,context,context,context,
157.7,161.77,and on this side you've got the bell side with an anti chill ring in place,context,context,context,
161.82,164.55,now to select which side you're going to listen through,context,subgoal,subgoal,
164.56,165.76,the whole thing rotates,context,context,context,
165.77,172.99,if you see me holding that central bevel and you might just hear that clicking it locks into place,context,instruction,context,
173.04,177.33,but basically if you look through here i don't know whether the video is gonna pick this up,context,context,context,
177.34,181.59,but if i adjust it you can see the lumen opening there and then closing as i adjust it,context,instruction,instruction,
181.66,185.04,that's obviously got to be in the right alignment to use it so this is a line,context,justification,justification,
185.05,193.95,now for that to be put onto the skin for us quotation to use the diaphragm you have to rotate it around that way now to fit this on again,instruction,instruction,instruction,
193.96,195.43,it's just a simple push fit,instruction,instruction,instruction,
195.44,197.26,onto the bottom of the tubing,instruction,instruction,instruction,
197.44,199.36,sometimes these can be very tight as you see,context,context,context,
199.37,202.36,this one is if that's the case and you want bit of assistance,context,justification,justification,
202.37,207.6,best thing to do is just to warm up the tubing by putting it into some warm just off boiling water,instruction,instruction (optional),instruction (optional),
207.61,214.38,just for a couple of seconds just so it's softens and then dry it completely,instruction,effect,effect,
,,because you won't get a grip on it and push it right on,justification,justification,justification,
214.39,,in this case right to the end where you've got the bevel on this design ,instruction,status,instruction,
,225.32,some of them won't have that they'll just have two little lines engraved into the actual tube that you push into the rubber tubing,instruction,context,context,
225.61,227.17,if that's the case just follow the guide,instruction,instruction,instruction,
227.18,231.04,it should be up to the second line on the bevel,instruction,context,instruction,
231.23,232,so there we go,outcome,outcome,outcome,
232.08,234.56,that's a fully constructed dual head stethoscope,outcome,outcome,outcome,
234.61,236.4,key thing here in the construction,reflection,reflection,reflection,
236.41,243.38,when you get it to make it comfortable and functional well is one to get the alignment right on that headset,reflection,reflection,reflection,
243.39,251.29,so you've got some four forward twists on the the headset that goes into your ears just like that,reflection,reflection,reflection,
251.3,253.03,now that's a personal setting,reflection,reflection,reflection,
253.12,256.91,you may want it a little more or you may want it a little less than that,reflection,reflection,reflection,
257,268.09,but if they are directly pointing at one another when they're relaxed then that's not going to sit in the normal alignment of the air canal to be comfortable,reflection,reflection,reflection,
268.16,275.14,but four degree slant of between ten and twenty degrees like that is probably going to be ideal for most users,reflection,reflection,reflection,
275.34,276.23,and that's it,reflection,reflection,reflection,
276.4,277.75,simple to construct,reflection,reflection,reflection,
279.34,284.74,for the money this is a an excellent value general news ward stethoscope,reflection,reflection,reflection,
285.65,289.08,it will give you basic chest and heart auscultation,reflection,reflection,reflection,
289.09,296.4,it won't give you high quality auscultation that you'd get with a cardiology model or a more expensive doctor stethoscope,reflection,reflection,reflection,
296.45,299.08,the lumen diameter on this simply isn't big enough,reflection,reflection,reflection,
299.09,306.04,but for doing blood pressures listening to chests for gross sounds or pathology this is ideal,reflection,reflection,reflection,
306.05,310.28,it's a cheap unit you've got to remember you're paying three four pounds for this,reflection,reflection,reflection,
310.35,313.72,even with delivery you're probably going to be getting it for under a fiver,reflection,reflection,reflection,
314.21,318.18,so it is a a good value budget starting unit,reflection,reflection,reflection,
318.19,321.76,don't expect the world from it but from value it's excellent,reflection,reflection,reflection,
321.81,322.58,so there you have it,closing,outcome,outcome,
