,,in this video i'm going to be showing you how to make an outdoor free standing projector screen that is large,goal,goal,goal,
7.6,10.51,affordable collapsible and totally portable,goal,goal,goal,
10.56,19.33,also be sure to stick around for the end of the video where i'll show you this tiny little projector that packs a real punch and is the perfect companion to this projector screen,side note,side note,side note,
28.27,34.48,the projector screen we're going to be building is made of pvc and will hold steady in windy areas like where we live,tool,tool,tool,
34.57,38.88,it provides a great picture and is perfect for outdoor movie nights with family and friends,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
38.95,43.08,for this project i used a good quality screen material that i purchased from amazon,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
43.15,47.18,this is carl's blackout cloth which you can pick up for about thirty five dollars,tool,tool specification,tool specification,
47.23,48.42,links are in the description,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
48.43,53.21,while you can use a bed sheet or other material this cloth is designed for projector screens,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
53.3,55.13,there's a finish side and a back,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
55.2,56.35,you can hear the difference,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
56.4,65.83,lie the screen on your carpet scratchy side up which is the back and fold over each side about three to four inches or eight to ten centimeters to make the pockets for the pvc pipe,instruction,instruction,instruction,
65.84,71.11,you can either use stitch witchery which is an adhesive strip for fabric or just sew it,instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),
72.7,74.77,i tried both and the stitch witchery stuff,context,tool specification,tool specification,
74.78,78.41,while a great option if you don't have access to a sewing machine is kind of a pain,context,tool specification,tool specification,
78.48,83.03,it requires you to lay it down between the fabric and put a towel under it so as not to melt your carpet,instruction,instruction (multiple),instruction,
83.04,89.15,put a damp cloth over it and then iron each side for about ten seconds each all the way along the length of it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
89.28,94.53,i tried this for one side and it took a while so i headed over to the sewing machine and sewed the other three sides,instruction,instruction,instruction,
94.54,97.97,both held up equally well but the sewing machine was much faster,context,instruction,context,
98.01,100.47,you don't need to be an expert tailor or seamstress,context,context,context,
100.58,102.55,this is what i call functional sewing,context,context,context,
102.65,104,it just needs to get the job done,context,context,context,
104.01,110.08,when you're done with each side cut a square in each of the four corners so that you can push the pvc pipes through them when you're done,instruction,instruction,instruction,
110.09,115.4,you should have a screen that is approximately sixteen by nine ratio and and it should look roughly like this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
118,125.37,next i did a bit of man sweeping in the garage to keep my screen from getting too dirty when i laid it out and started getting my measurements,instruction,instruction,instruction,
125.54,129.41,be sure to take multiple measurements in case your sides aren't perfectly straight,instruction,instruction,instruction,
130.08,134.81,for my screen the measurements were one hundred and two inches wide by fifty eight inches high,instruction,instruction,instruction,
135.02,137.97,i'm using one and a half inch pvc for this build,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
138.28,145.59,take your width measurement and start by subtracting two inches to accommodate for the one inch depth of the elbows for the top and bottom rails,instruction,instruction,instruction,
145.6,149.29,i'm going to break it down into two sections so that the kit is a little bit more portable,instruction,instruction,instruction,
149.93,154.36,you'll lose about a quarter inch because of the coupling so you'll need to subtract that as well,instruction,instruction,instruction,
154.41,158.9,lastly divide that result by two so that you can break your pipe into two sections,instruction,instruction,instruction,
158.94,162.4,you will need four pieces two for the top and two for the bottom,instruction,instruction,instruction,
162.55,163.88,the sides are much simpler,instruction,instruction,instruction,
163.89,166.58,just subtract two inches from the height and you're all set,instruction,instruction,instruction,
166.71,171.95,you should end up with four identically sized pieces for the top and bottom rails and two slightly longer,context,context,context,
171.96,173.84,identical sized pieces for the sides,context,context,context,
175.32,177.72,you've got several options for cutting the pvc,tool (multiple),tool (multiple),tool (multiple),
177.78,180.27,the first is to use a pvc pipe cutter,tool,tool,tool,
180.36,183.07,these are pretty inexpensive and links are in the description,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
183.2,184.87,they're super easy to use,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
185,188.35,they're also the cleanest option ,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
188.36,191.55,if you have a hacksaw you can use that too but it is a lot of work and a lot of mess,tool (multiple),tool (multiple),tool (multiple),
191.62,195.21,plus you're going to have to sand every cut because it leaves them pretty rough,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
195.7,200.75,if you have access to a miter saw or chopsaw that's definitely the easiest and quickest way to go,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
200.84,203.05,that's what i chose to use for this project,context,context,context,
204.14,208.89,once you've got your six pieces cut lay them out for a quick test fit to make sure everything lines up,instruction,instruction,instruction,
208.96,212.09,and then try to fit them into the screen and see how that goes,instruction,instruction,instruction,
212.28,213.91,if it's too big that's ok,instruction,instruction,instruction,
213.92,215.48,we want to start a little large,instruction,instruction,instruction,
215.6,223.31,we want to cut the pipes down until they barely fit and that's what's going to keep the tension on the screen and stretch it tight to get rid of the wrinkles and the creases,instruction,instruction,instruction,
223.64,226.23,keep adjusting until you get it to fit nice and tight,instruction,instruction,instruction,
226.28,229.91,once that's squared away you can make the cuts for the legs and feet,instruction,instruction,instruction,
230.04,233.15,the stand is just two feet and a leg for each side,instruction,instruction,instruction,
233.2,239.55,i made my feet about eighteen inches wide so that the base would be about three feet across and the legs were about two feet high,instruction,instruction,instruction,
239.59,241.3,but feel free to adjust as needed,instruction,instruction,instruction,
241.65,247.76,put these together with one t and two end caps each then attach them to the screen to stand it up to da,instruction,instruction,instruction,
247.83,249.29,the screen is almost done,status,instruction,status,
250.39,256.88,now if you want to add some tie downs for windy conditions one way to do that is to drill a hole into each side of the vertical poles,instruction,status,instruction,
256.89,263.16,about halfway up drill through the outside of the pc and then slightly into the other side but not through,instruction,instruction,instruction,
263.28,267.94,the reason for that is you can drive a three inch screw into each side and it'll fit right into place,instruction,instruction,instruction,
268.23,278.96,these act as the connector for the tie downs drives mistakes into the ground or you can just use some heavy objects like your kids and then use paracord to tie the screen to the steaks or the kids,instruction,instruction,instruction,
279.31,281.44,be sure to have a helper if you're setting the screen up,instruction,instruction,instruction,
281.45,287.34,in very windy conditions like you see here you can then use a lighter to melt the ends of the paracord to prevent fraying,instruction,instruction,instruction,
287.75,290.98,with that you're all done except that you're not,status,status,status,
291.07,293.91,i thought i was finished but then i noticed the horizontal folds,status,status,status,
294.07,296.5,i came up with a solution for this that works pretty well,context,context,context,
296.65,299.82,i created a stretcher bar to fit between the top and bottom poles,context,context,context,
299.87,311.02,i had to make a small cut in the sleeves at the top and bottom and then i put a three inch screw at the top and the bottom of a pole and space them just far enough apart that they stretched the top and bottom poles apart,instruction,instruction,instruction,
311.27,312.58,with the stretcher bar in place,instruction,instruction,instruction,
312.59,318.38,the wrinkles were almost gone and the only one that was left was really small and didn't even show up when the screen was in use,effect,effect,effect,
318.61,320.96,now it's done in backyard,outcome,outcome,outcome,
320.97,322.14,movie night is on,outcome,outcome,outcome,
