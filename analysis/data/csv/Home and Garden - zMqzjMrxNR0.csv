1.58,2.06,hey gang,opening,opening,opening,
2.07,3.63,welcome back to another video,opening,opening,opening,
3.64,9.09,in today's video i'm going to be showing you a very useful locksmith tool,goal,goal,goal,
9.42,16.05,now in the event a key has been lost for a dead bolt or any other lock is only two ways that you're going to be unlocking it,motivation,motivation,motivation,
16.1,26.39,you're either going to have to pick the lock or you're going to have to drill out the key way to allow the pins inside to fall down to allow the plug to rotate,motivation,motivation,motivation,
26.52,31.47,the tool i'm about to show you is going to be very useful if you go to pick the lock,motivation,motivation,motivation,
31.57,36.19,now when you go to lock the door of course you're going to rotate clockwise,context,motivation,,
36.24,40.92,when you rotate clockwise the bolt will extend into the door jam,context,motivation,,
41.2,47.26,when you put the key in and you rotate to the left the bolt will slide in,context,motivation,,
47.33,53.62,now the problem you can have with some deadbolts is that it's very easy to pick one direction,context,motivation,,
53.67,55.24,but not the other way,context,motivation,,
55.29,61.96,so for instance in order to open this you'd have to pick it up and then rotate counterclockwise and put that in,context,motivation,,
61.97,63.39,and that would be unlocking it,context,motivation,,
63.79,69.84,of course if you pick it in the opposite direction all it's going to be doing is absolutely nothing,context,motivation,,
69.85,72.03,pushing that bolt more into the jam,context,motivation,,
72.17,77.7,and then when you go to take the tension key and rotate it back to try and get it to go the other way,context,motivation,,
77.75,80.66,it's going to line up with the pins again and lock in,context,motivation,,
80.67,91.08,the position right here with this tool is going to allow you to do is pick this in the wrong direction and then you could spin counterclockwise very quickly,tool specification,briefing,,
91.35,95.85,i guess the section where the pins would line up allowing it to pull the deadbolt in,tool specification,briefing,,
95.96,97.45,let me just show you how this works,bridge,bridge,bridge,
98.14,108.97,so right here you could see the bolt is extended and now it's going back in,context,status,,
109.1,116.9,so i'm going to do is close the door all right,context,instruction,,
121.71,122.58,is now locked,context,status,,
122.81,128,so the first thing i'm going to do is pick this in a clockwise direction which is the wrong way,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
128.25,133.85,i have this tension wrench which allows you to put a varying amount of pressure on that plug or core,tool speficiation,tool,,
134.53,137.16,depending on the lock that you have they all vary,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
137.25,142.24,some may require very little tension and others may require a lot,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
142.37,149,if you have spool pins in here which are security pins designed to hang up when you're trying to pick them,tool specification,tool,,
149.05,154.24,then the best thing you could do with those is go all the way in push them all the way to the top,instruction,instruction,instruction,
154.25,155.88,and put a lot of tension,instruction,instruction,instruction,
155.89,156.36,on it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
156.73,160.3,and then when you do that you can rake them down very lightly,instruction,instruction,instruction,
160.37,162.84,as you're letting pressure off on the tension wrench,instruction,instruction,instruction,
163.53,166.14,keep raking and it'll help you get this to open,instruction,instruction,instruction,
166.15,168.88,much easier to deal with those pool pens,effect,instruction,,
169.63,170.62,so let me get this going,bridge,bridge,bridge,
170.63,172.39,first let me pick this the right way,instruction,bridge,,
173.76,174.17,all right,bridge,bridge,bridge,
174.18,177.85,i'm going to push all the pins to the top using this tool i made,instruction,instruction,instruction,
177.86,178.72,it's a diamond pick,tool,tool,tool,
179.37,188.15,i ground this down using spring steel years ago and started upside down and we push all the pins to the top and put heavy tension,instruction,instruction,instruction,
189.03,192.46,so now every one of those pins is up including the spool pins,context,effect,,
192.59,195.2,and i'm just going to rake this very slowly,instruction,instruction,instruction,
195.21,205.62,as i'm letting off on my tension key tension wrench keep going to the feel of sought to drop a little bit and now it's starting to drop a little bit,instruction,instruction,instruction,
207.37,207.66,all right,bridge,bridge,bridge,
207.67,215.14,so now that's the time i'm going to switch to the lifter see if i can manipulate each one,instruction,instruction,instruction,
217.59,223.85,like like trusting the tension of that wrench let a little bit more pressure off,instruction,instruction,instruction,
232.09,238.32,oh ok going,filler,filler,filler,
238.33,253.49,i should break here,status,filler,,
253.5,254.02,it is all right,status,status,status,
254.03,255.31,so now i'm gonna leave it like that,status,status,status,
255.5,257.13,alright it rotated clockwise,status,status,status,
258.55,259.22,it's locked,status,status,status,
259.41,261.64,if you try and spin it back the other direction,instruction,status,,
261.65,262.37,what's going to happen,effect,status,,
262.38,268.31,it's going to line up and lock without turning completely counterclockwise to retract the bolt,effect,status,,
268.59,272.73,so if i go here watch could actually over here,instruction,status,,
275.67,284.11,you can see how it got caught up right there with the tools is going to allow you to do is completely spin that right past that point,tool specification,status,,
284.16,285.79,so let me pick that one more time,bridge,bridge,bridge,
285.86,290.35,ok with the lock pick and that direction we're now going to use this specialized tool,tool,subgoal,,
294.15,294.37,now,instruction,subgoal,,
294.38,299.85,i want to rotate this counterclockwise so i'm going to pull on this rotate it to there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
300.58,305.4,i'm going to insert it in the key way and i'm going to push on the door,instruction,instruction,instruction,
305.41,306.5,and it should spin it right,instruction,instruction,instruction,
306.51,307.24,open up,instruction,instruction,instruction,
307.85,310.75,there you go and that's how you do it,outcome,outcome,outcome,
312.04,312.25,now,outcome,instruction,,
312.26,316.42,i could put this key back in there and rotate it to the top and you can see it locked back in,outcome,instruction,,
317.15,318.94,extremely useful tool,reflection,reflection,reflection,
318.95,323.36,could save you a lot of time if you have trouble picking this in the right direction,reflection,reflection,reflection,
