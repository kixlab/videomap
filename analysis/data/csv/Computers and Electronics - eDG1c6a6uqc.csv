1.38,2.17,hi guys,opening,opening,opening,
2.26,3.57,welcome back to my channel,opening,opening,opening,
3.58,14.27,and in this video i'm going to teach you how to convert a single phase ac to dc converter also known as a rectifier into a three phase rectifier,goal,goal,goal,
14.34,17.39,so first what we need is a rectifier,tool,tool,tool,
17.78,21.59,so a rectifier a single phase rectifier looks like this,tool,tool,tool,
21.6,26.31,it has four terminals two for a c and other two for positive and the negative,context,tool specification,tool specification,
26.6,32.8,yeah it shows on this terminal positive on this terminal and the the easy on this terminal,context,tool specification,tool specification,
33.26,35.41,so it works diagonal,context,tool specification,tool specification,
35.72,41.93,so the positive on this terminal then the negative will be on the other diagonal terminal which will be this as similarly,context,tool specification,tool specification,
41.94,44.19,this and this will be the ac terminals,context,tool specification,tool specification,
45.84,50.27,and the other thing that you need are two high ampere diodes,tool,tool,tool,
50.7,51.33,and you can see it,tool,tool,tool,
51.34,52.17,as intrinsic says,tool,tool,tool,
52.18,61.74,so i'm using six ampere diodes and i have to use two of them to convert the single phase into a three phase in a diode,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
61.79,68.2,the silver the silver side indicates the negative side and the black side indicates the positive side,context,context,context,
68.41,71.88,so what we are going to do to proceed to the first step,bridge,bridge,bridge,
71.93,79.13,we will have to solder the negative side of this diode to the positive terminal of the rectifier,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
79.53,91.23,so this side of the diode will stick to the positive of the rectifier and the positive side of the diode will stick to the diagonal negative of the rigidified,instruction,instruction,instruction,
92.64,99.83,so now guys you have to connect two diodes like this one on the back of one diode is connected to the front of the other diode,status,status,status,
99.88,104.42,and the joint wire will be connected at the joint point in between,status,status,status,
105.73,112.09,and then after you have done that then you will connect the wires and these are two clips that fit,instruction,instruction,instruction,
112.76,119.97,do the terminals of the rectifier and these are of the seven inch battery and the ups lead acid battery,instruction,instruction,instruction,
120.8,121.63,so i'm connecting,instruction,instruction,instruction,
121.64,124.92,i'm going to connect the green wire to the positive terminal of the rectifier,instruction,instruction,instruction,
125.97,133.23,yes it's like this and then the brown wire to the negative which will be the diagonal,instruction,instruction,instruction,
133.96,136.95,this is the diagonal that this will be the negative,status,status,status,
137.08,140.31,so i'm connecting the brown wire here and it's done,instruction,instruction,instruction,
142.14,142.79,like this,status,status,status,
143.26,149.33,now the final step is are you have to connect the two diodes to these two wires,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
149.44,150.17,smaller ones,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
151.42,154.39,oh ok do it like this,bridge,bridge,bridge,
154.56,156.47,now this one says the positive,status,status,status,
156.92,160.42,so we have to connect the negative of the diode to the positive,instruction,instruction,instruction,
161.18,162.28,so it will be like this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
165.57,169.05,yeah and the positive of the diode to the negative,instruction,instruction,instruction,
171.62,182.2,it was like this there is something like this and this one is the positive,status,status,status,
182.25,185.88,this one is the negative and this one is the third ac,status,status,status,
186.31,188.6,so you already have the two ac terminals,status,status,status,
188.67,190.88,one and the other one is two,status,status,status,
191.01,197.44,now the third ac wire will be the white one and this will then become a three phase rectifier,status,context,status,
198.45,200.04,so guys it's done,bridge,bridge,bridge,
200.05,203.4,and now it's time for us to test the device,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
204.21,211.74,so for this we have a three phase generator ok and a d c light bulb,tool,tool,tool,
213.11,218.88,so the connections in the green one says the positive,status,status,status,
219.26,232.34,so the positive of this led will be connected here like this and the negative of the led will be connected to the brown wire,instruction,instruction,instruction,
237.81,250.01,k yeah uh so the output terminals have been connected,status,status,status,
250.02,254.46,now we have to connect the generator to this to this three phase rectifier,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
255.37,257.45,so connected in any way you want,instruction,instruction,instruction,
258.51,259.49,all right any domain,instruction,instruction,instruction,
260.22,261.42,do any of the easy dominos,instruction,instruction,instruction,
263.19,266.8,i have connected the white one to the white blue one,status,status,status,
273.81,278.17,i like this and then dump the other white one,instruction,instruction,instruction,
288.31,289.48,so the connection has been done,status,status,status,
290.22,306.4,now when i i will rotate the generator should light up so you can see that it is working and it will work in either direction,outcome,outcome,outcome,
306.41,310.67,now i'm i'm rotating in this direction and then also it is lighting up,outcome,outcome,outcome,
311.94,324.57,no because this is a rectifier so it will produce positive and negative and the specific side irrespective of the direction of the motion in which i rotate this rotation this direction then also it is blowing up,context,context,context,
325.54,326.77,and this also,outcome,outcome,outcome,
330.02,335.48,so we have successfully converted our single phase bridge rectifier into a three phase rectifier,outcome,outcome,outcome,
337.37,343.36,and also it has a removable when we remove these two that again becomes our single phase rectifier,reflection,reflection,reflection,
344.37,345.92,so this was all about the video,closing,closing,closing,
345.93,347.21,thank you so much for watching it,closing,closing,closing,
347.47,350.32,thank you and please don't forget to hit like cheering for cry,self-promo,self-promo,self-promo,
