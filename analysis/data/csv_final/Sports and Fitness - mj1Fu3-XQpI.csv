0.72,2.67,hi everyone this is the building's doctor here,opening,opening,opening,
2.74,5.15,so for today's video i want to talk to you guys about tip tools,goal,goal,goal,
5.2,8.43,so these are two tip tools i like to use,tool,tool,tool,
8.66,15.09,this is the q tech bow tie tip tool and it is great because it has three different pieces to it,tool,tool,tool,
15.1,19.91,it has the scuffing piece which is up here and that's used you,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
19.92,24.52,what you do is you put it kind of on the edge like this is kind of twist your queue around it like that,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
25.22,32.21,and what that does is it loosens up the tip a little bit so it holds chalk better so that that's the scuff,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
32.6,41.21,then there's this end here which allows you to actually shape the q tip to whatever type of tip tool you got,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
41.26,51.27,so they have different radiuses for the tip tool which basically determines like how rounded it is and you can go anywhere from a quarter radius which is used for like break cues and junk,context,tool specification,tool specification,
51.28,54.37,usage is like it's a big radius so that's very flat media,context,tool specification,tool specification,
54.38,64.68,quarter is much flatter so it's a flatter radius or the dime radius is usually what most players use on their playing cues and that's gonna be very rounded so some of these smaller radius,context,tool specification,tool specification,
64.76,68.28,so the flatter your tip is the less spin you get,context,tool specification,tool specification,
68.35,72.9,so if you want to get spin then you most people use like a dime radius on their plane q,context,tool specification,tool specification,
73.01,78.7,but when you don't want to spend like on a on a break queue then you want to use a quarter anyway,context,tool specification,tool specification,
78.71,85.97,so what you do is you can have it this side here and you can shape it and what how i like to shape it is,instruction,instruction,instruction,
86.16,95.88,i usually like to what the queue up like this can i put it down with my left hand as i'm right handed and i see that it's flat,instruction,instruction,instruction,
95.93,105.67,i see that the that the tool is flat and that when i know what i'm gonna do is i'm going to twist it with my right hand and i'm gonna make sure it stays at that same height,instruction,instruction,instruction,
105.68,107.35,perfectly flat the whole time,instruction,instruction,instruction,
107.46,111.55,so i'm getting the exact radius that i want from the tip tool,effect,effect,effect,
111.64,114.28,now you can do so that was what i was doing,context,context,context,
114.29,116.6,i was literally keeping it perfectly straight up and down,context,context,context,
116.61,122.31,and then i was twisting the shaft with my other hand and putting pressure with my left hand,context,context,context,
122.8,123.87,you can do it that way,context,context,context,
123.88,131.8,some people also will put at an angle do the same thing some sort of having it perfectly and i don't have an angle and that'll give you a different radius,context,instruction (multiple),context,
132.05,139.52,i i prefer to just keep it perfectly straight up and down because i know i'm getting exactly the radius that i was supposed to get from it,justification,justification,justification,
140.21,142.16,and if i go dime i know i'm getting dime,context,effect,effect,
142.17,143.65,and i'm getting dime every single time,context,effect,effect,
143.66,149.46,every time i every time i get the radius done i get a dime radius,context,effect,effect,
150.3,152.02,so that's this tip tool,tool,subgoal,tool,
152.03,157.68,it also has an aerator piece which if you unscrew the cap here it has this aerators these like little spiky things,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
158.58,165.35,see here these little spiky things and this is used to also to kind of loosen up the tip and allow you to hold chalk better,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
165.36,172.93,so if you play a lot of pool and you haven't gotten your tip replace oftentimes the tip will harden and when it hardens it won't hold chalk very well,context,context,context,
173.06,180.98,what you can do is you can take the spikes and you can poke it like this and that allows it to old chalk better,instruction,instruction,instruction,
180.99,186.84,creates a little tiny holes that the chalk kind of goes in the holes and it just holds like chalk better so you don't have to talk as much,context,effect,effect,
186.93,193.16,theoretically i still recommend chalking after every shot but this helps make it not so hard that being said,context,instruction,instruction,
193.17,194.14,there's another way to use it,context,bridge,bridge,
194.15,197.43,you can also push into it push into it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
197.5,200.21,will you don't want to do is you don't want to push and twist,warning,warning,warning,
200.28,203.77,ok pushing and then twisting into it is going to ruin the tip,warning,warning,warning,
203.82,206.99,if you're going to like ruin the fibers or break the fibers you don't want to be doing that,warning,warning,warning,
207,210.09,ok you can tap it or you can push,instruction,instruction,instruction,
210.54,211.87,ok you don't usually do it all,instruction,instruction,instruction,
211.88,212.83,i don't use it a lot,instruction,instruction,instruction,
212.84,216.95,i just do it like a little bit if my tips like super hard and that's not holding chalk very well,instruction,instruction,instruction,
216.96,221.33,if i miskew or something i'll probably use this to make sure that it's only talk better,instruction,instruction,instruction,
222.34,223.97,so that's you have the scuffing in,tool,tool,tool,
223.98,229.36,like i said the scuffing in here does something very similar to the aerator,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
229.45,230.86,it's pretty much the same concept,context,tool specification,context,
230.87,232.96,you just scuff it up to basically soak it hold chalk,context,instruction,instruction,
232.97,238.27,you're not changing the actual shape whereas the other end actually allows you to actually shape the tip,context,context,context,
238.31,240.24,so that's what i did earlier with that,justification,bridge,context,
240.35,243.55,now this is the q tech bow tie tip tool,tool,tool,tool,
244.03,250.8,this is the willards dime tip tool here and this is,tool,tool specification,tool specification,
250.81,251.76,i really like this tool,side note,side note,side note,
251.77,252.89,this is my favorite,side note,side note,side note,
252.97,259.22,i really like it because it has this little arch here and this arch is a dime radius so it tells me exactly when it's at a dime,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
259.27,262.56,so what i'll do is i do the same thing i did with the q tech one,instruction,subgoal,subgoal,
262.63,270.44,i'll put hold it up right like this i'll put this one up so that it's it's a flat like this and i'll push down with my left hand,instruction,instruction,instruction,
272.12,277.29,so like this put pressure with my left hand and then i'll look at it and make sure that it's flat,instruction,instruction,instruction,
277.48,280.75,and then i'll twist it and make sure that it's staying flat the whole time,instruction,instruction,instruction,
280.76,283.19,so i'm making sure it's staying flat like this the whole time,instruction,instruction,instruction,
283.24,285.84,so i'm getting even amount on every single side,instruction,instruction,instruction,
285.85,289.67,i'm getting that dime shape every single time that i have to shape my my tip,instruction,instruction,instruction,
289.84,298.13,and then when i'm done i can take this tip tool and i can match it up to my queue and make sure that it fits perfectly,instruction,instruction,instruction,
298.84,303.26,and if it doesn't fit perfectly then i have to keep doing it until it does fit perfectly,instruction,instruction,instruction,
303.27,305.82,and then by the time you're done it should be a perfect dime shape,instruction,instruction,instruction,
305.87,307.59,so i really like to use these,side note,side note,side note,
307.6,310.22,i'd probably use them like,side note,instruction,instruction,
310.27,310.96,i don't know,side note,instruction,instruction,
310.97,313.44,once a month or so i'll reshape my tip,side note,instruction,instruction,
313.45,314.47,not very often,side note,instruction,instruction,
315.67,317.92,i play like maybe three times a week for an hour and a half,side note,context,instruction,
317.93,319.06,each time i'll probably shave it,side note,context,instruction,
319.07,319.78,like once a month,side note,context,instruction,
319.79,321.56,i get the tip replaced itself,side note,context,instruction,
321.57,323.16,probably like once every eight months,side note,context,instruction,
323.17,332.12,but make sure like just some tips for like taking care of your q tips is you don't want to get any water or liquid,instruction,warning,warning,
332.19,335.93,ok so like i don't ever like put water on the tip,warning,warning,warning,
335.94,337.01,you don't want to be doing that,warning,warning,warning,
337.02,338.84,that's going to actually cause it to harden,warning,warning,warning,
339.38,346.22,other things you want to keep in mind is that you want to make sure it doesn't get too low,warning,warning,warning,
346.27,349.74,so sometimes when you're playing a lot it'll get lower and lower and lower,context,warning,warning,
349.81,353.7,and if it gets too low you can damage the feral which is the white part here,context,warning,warning,
354.09,355.68,so you don't want to get too low,warning,warning,warning,
355.69,358.62,so make sure you're keeping an eye out for that and you get it replaced,instruction,warning,warning,
358.89,363.4,my break q tip got super low and i didn't even realize it until like last minute and i was like oh,side note,side note,side note,
363.41,366.94,shoot i really should get this replaced so you want to get that replaced,side note,side note,side note,
367.73,371.17,and i think if there's anything else about q tip,bridge,bridge,bridge,
371.18,378.43,hence it's nice before you use these tip tools that you actually take a dry paper towel and you wipe off the chocks,instruction,instruction,instruction,
378.44,382.96,you don't get chalk in the tip tools but that doesn't really matter just make sure the paper towels not wet,instruction,instruction,instruction,
383.34,389.39,you'll see some players will actually like when they chalk after they're done chalking them below on the tip,context,warning,warning,
389.44,397.2,and that's not a good habit to get into because you're actually adding like liquid to the tip by doing that a little bit and that'll harden it over time,context,warning,warning,
397.21,400.68,you don't want to be doing that so ideally trying not to do that,warning,warning,warning,
400.79,404.5,honestly i've never had any issues by having too much chalk on my queue,side note,side note,side note,
404.51,412.88,like as long as you get a decent type of chalk like masters or predator or something like it should go on pretty smoothly like it's not going to if you have too much talk,context,side note,context,
412.89,,from my experience i haven't had any issues with having too much chalk on the queue,context,side note,context,
,426.22,so there's really no need to blow off chalk like that it'll only add liquid to your queue and then cause your queue to like harden over time which is not good,context,warning,warning,
427.29,427.96,and that's it,closing,bridge,bridge,
427.97,430.4,and of course there's there's different types of tips you can get,reflection,reflection,reflection,
430.41,433.86,like i said the radius of the tip can vary that's going to be the arch of the tip,reflection,reflection,reflection,
433.91,435.46,and you can do like customize,reflection,reflection,reflection,
435.47,439.62,you can do dime quarter so there's things you can do to get special tip tools that do each,reflection,reflection,reflection,
439.81,450.39,i would recommend dime predator did a study about the different radii of tips and they discovered that dime is the best overall for you to use,reflection,reflection,reflection,
450.45,453.36,and if you're not if you don't use a dime and you're a beginner,reflection,reflection,reflection,
453.45,460.02,i still kind of recommend doing dime because you can get used to it and it is going to allow you to get better spin anyways,reflection,reflection,reflection,
460.15,462.66,even backspin and top spin everything so,reflection,reflection,reflection,
463.04,464.31,but it's personal preference,reflection,reflection,reflection,
464.32,465.33,like some people like to do,reflection,reflection,reflection,
465.34,468.81,custom tip shaper and they'll do it like even flatter than a dime,reflection,reflection,reflection,
468.82,472.49,or they'll do it even even you know even more steep than a dime,reflection,reflection,reflection,
472.5,474.05,so it's it's all personal preference,reflection,reflection,reflection,
475.49,477.16,alright let's see what else,closing,closing,closing,
479.12,480.52,i guess that's all i got for you guys,closing,closing,closing,
480.53,483.54,so thanks for watching and stay tuned for more videos,closing,closing,closing,
