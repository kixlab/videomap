235.72,246.15,i've seen quite a few people use coffee filters or you could even put a large rock over the hole that doesn't fully seal so water can still go through it,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
246.16,249.41,so i'm just going to fill my pot with this soil mixture,instruction,instruction,instruction,

293.89,299.78,hoyas are epiphytic plants so what that means is they don't like to sit around soil,context,context,context,
299.79,310.8,they are very prone to root rot which is why i use this mixture that i created today because it keeps the soil light and fluffy and chunky,context,context,context,
310.81,318.34,and it lets air go through the soil to get to those roots because those roots want equal parts of water and air,context,context,context,
318.41,325.82,this mixture really helps to keep those roots aerated and keeps the plant nice and healthy,context,context,context,
