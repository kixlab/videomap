0.17,2.1,hey my name is anthony minson,opening,opening,opening,
2.17,12.12,i did a tutorial on how to remove the keys off of a butterfly once type on the think it's twenty fifteen macbook,motivation,opening,motivation,
12.25,18,i'm doing video on how to take the keys off of a twenty sixteen method,goal,goal,goal,
22.46,32.91,now with the as you can see with these keys not suppose they're not meant to like be taken off,context,context,context,
32.92,43.14,but you can clean around the edges what your you can like take off the keys but you're like you might actually just break them,context,context,context,
43.39,48.32,so the best way to like clean them and let's say it's not pushing,context,context,context,
48.39,60.56,some people have said that like you can just like push them a little bit harder like are there and tell they just like you keep playing with them until they start like i am working,context,context,context,
61.81,73.15,a lot of people have said like if you just like i used needles i used two needles and i also have this which is a nail file,tool,tool,tool,
74.79,87.05,i use two needles and you can like some people said that they get like junk around the edges ok or on the inside edges of it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
88.53,107.75,so what you want to do to be able to remove it is you pry two two needles into it and you lift up like this and then you use the nail file and you wedge it underneath the middle right here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
109.3,119.99,ok so once the top is released the uh the bottom i can just pop off like that,effect,effect,effect,
120.19,129.68,on the bottom of this there are two two the pieces that latch on right here and right here,status,status,status,
129.77,133.08,and then on the top there are two hinges,status,status,status,
133.97,141.26,the the they're like snap on to the butterfly mechanism and now here is the butterfly mechanism,status,status,status,
142.22,149.28,there is there is the top right here and then the bottom part here,status,status,status,
149.79,164.34,and so if you want you can use the needle and part of the better fine mechanism from the from where it's attached to it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
164.35,167.56,so i don't think this part should be removed,context,context,context,
167.63,169.42,the butterfly mechanism switch,context,context,context,
171.39,187.33,you don't really need to remove it anyway because really what you wanna do is you wanna get this piece off and you want to clean around the corners of it because that's what's like gonna be making it so that it's hard to,context,context,context,
188.09,191.39,the best thing to do is not to take these off,instruction,instruction,instruction,
192.55,196.51,the best thing to do is just put a needle down there and clean her on the edges,instruction,instruction,instruction,
198.7,204.85,if apple keeps on returning your computer and and you keep on having to do this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
204.86,217.96,this might be like the best like last option to be able to clean it because you are like in danger of like breaking the pieces at the bottom that are like attach onto the butterfly mechanism,warning,warning,warning,
219.24,221.96,which is not what you want to end up doing it,warning,warning,warning,
225.92,229.21,so yeah we getting it back on motivation pretty simple,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
230.21,234.83,m you just have to go,instruction,instruction,instruction,
237.19,242.67,it's just like pop up on the bottom and then make sure that the top pops back on,instruction,instruction,instruction,
242.74,247.53,you can pretty much just place it in there and then push it back on there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
249.01,249.66,and there you go,outcome,outcome,outcome,
254.93,257.04,and it's good,outcome,outcome,outcome,
259.77,267.1,and that is how to take the keyboard keys off of a twenty sixteen,outcome,outcome,outcome,
267.15,268.56,macbook pro,outcome,outcome,outcome,
268.95,278.38,best to clean the edges with the needle first but then if you have to you have to take it off from the top or else it'll break the bottom parts,reflection,reflection,reflection,
278.53,291.96,you got to be really careful with the bottom parts because on the top there's like these two things that like clamp on to the butterfly mechanism and on the bottom there's these two parts that kind of like pop on to the two sides of the butterfly mechanism part,reflection,reflection,reflection,
293.36,293.76,cool,closing,closing,closing,
294.64,296.53,thanks,closing,closing,closing,
