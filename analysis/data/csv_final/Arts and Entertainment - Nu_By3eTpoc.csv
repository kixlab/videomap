4.57,10.36,so formatted video about this in the past although that was about two years ago so therefore obviously doesn't count,opening,motivation,motivation,
10.41,22.24,so a lot of you guys have been asking how do i make my lightsabers glow and my stop motions like how to make a picture simply look like loads like this,motivation,motivation,motivation,
23.18,24.81,like look how else and that looks,motivation,motivation,motivation,
24.82,28.87,there's real light savers not really so like,side note,motivation,side note,
28.88,36.6,the main question was from rec rex films and he was wondering how i did it,motivation,motivation,motivation,
36.88,40.31,and so yeah i said i'll do a tutorial because why not,motivation,motivation,motivation,
40.38,45.89,also the program that you will be needing is gimp link is in the description,tool specification,tool,tool,
45.96,47.21,i'll put it in this description,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
47.22,48.81,it's also in this description right here,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
48.82,52.44,just download that and then boost it up and then you're ready to go,instruction,instruction,instruction,
52.56,54.03,and then you could just follow along with me,instruction,bridge,bridge,
54.04,55.11,whatever i'm doing here,instruction,bridge,bridge,
55.15,58.07,so i just took a picture of a fader,instruction,instruction,instruction,
58.68,60.83,it's very dusty kind of,side note,status,side note,
60.98,61.61,i don't know,side note,status,side note,
61.69,62.99,there's a hair right here,side note,status,side note,
63.08,68.51,as you see i was not prepared but it doesn't matter because we're going to make this thing glow,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
68.56,76.35,so what you wanna do is do layer new layer make sure it's on transparency because that's very important to do,instruction,instruction,instruction,
76.36,98.57,ok and now we're going to be grabbing her lasso tool go to the color that you need for your glow which is going to be red and then you do control and then do your scroll wheel and then you scroll forward and then you just start selecting please scroll wheel,instruction,instruction,instruction,
98.58,102.15,i mean just like zoom in on like the scroll wheel of your mouse,instruction,instruction,instruction,
102.16,108.5,although if you have like a mouse pad then just like the zoom in or something or you can't really do that,instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),
108.51,110.98,then just do this and then zoom in like that,instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),
111.59,121.7,but once you select all of this like so they all have this weird black and white daddy's thingy,instruction,instruction,instruction,
121.77,129.83,then you just grab your paint bucket tool do that chow and then you instead of doing layer new layer,instruction,instruction,instruction,
130.59,137.31,you can just do a shift control n which i tend to do a lot and make sure that this thing is still selected,instruction,instruction,instruction,
137.48,142.88,and also make sure that this layer is on transparency and then switch to the white and click on it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
143.58,148.45,and then you can do shift control a which will deselect it all,instruction,instruction,instruction,
148.51,150.64,or if i just do control z here we'll click,instruction,instruction,instruction,
150.65,152.73,you can use select none,instruction,instruction,instruction,
152.92,160.01,so once you do that go over here right click on your layer duplicate layer and then go on the bottom layer,instruction,instruction,instruction,
160.08,168.75,i tend to make the bottom layer a bigger glow than the one on top and so i just use this little crosshair thing to find where my glow is,instruction,instruction,instruction,
168.8,173.35,by the way i meant to say do you filters blur dodgy and blur before i started doing all of this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
173.82,175.91,and then it really depends on the size of your picture,instruction,instruction,instruction,
175.98,188.18,for this i would say belt five hundred for the bottom layer and then once that loads it already kind of looks like a lightsaber,instruction,instruction,instruction,
188.23,195.4,so then you want to grab your second red layer or whatever your color of your glow is and then do gaussian blur again,instruction,instruction,instruction,
195.69,201.58,and then i just tend to make this about half of the same size as the first one was although i don't want to make it exactly half,instruction,instruction,instruction,
201.59,203.5,so i'm just going to do like two eighty,instruction,instruction,instruction,
203.67,207.79,or i tend to do like three hundred or something,instruction,instruction,instruction,
209.89,213.02,but once that it's done see there you go,status,status,status,
213.07,215.42,but it looks like it's just white and then red,status,status,status,
215.46,218.64,but i want to make it so that the white looks like it's going into the red,subgoal,context,subgoal,
218.71,222.54,so then i'm also going to duplicate my white layer,instruction,instruction,instruction,
222.61,226,and then do filters blur gaussian blur,instruction,instruction,instruction,
226.79,232.2,and then i turned to make this one about fifty to seventy,instruction,instruction,instruction,
232.25,236.84,so i'm just going to do sixty by doing that and then click on,instruction,instruction,instruction,
236.85,241.64,ok and then that looks kind of small,status,instruction,effect,
241.65,243.2,i'm just going to do control z,status,instruction,instruction,
244.59,248.28,it really depends on how close the light saber is on the to the picture,instruction,context,context,
248.29,251.58,so maybe about this one i would do ninety one,instruction,instruction,instruction,
251.88,252.96,yeah that looks good,status,status,status,
255.6,261.07,yeah i think that looks cool but we're still not done yet because it looks like the whites just sticking out,instruction,instruction,instruction,
261.16,263.29,and so we need to click on this layer,instruction,instruction,instruction,
263.38,265.29,do filters blur,instruction,instruction,instruction,
265.36,266.55,gaussian blur,instruction,instruction,instruction,
266.74,273.34,i normally do a five so there you go,instruction,instruction,instruction,
