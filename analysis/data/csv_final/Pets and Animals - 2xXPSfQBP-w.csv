12.27,17.36,so my last video i showed you guys that i got a western saddle,motivation,motivation,motivation,,
17.48,18.52,that was really cool,motivation,motivation,motivation,,
19.19,24.18,but when you get a new saddle something that happens especially with the western one's the stirrups,motivation,motivation,motivation,,
24.89,33.53,usually go play in the same plane as your horse but i have a solution for that and i'm going to share that with you today,motivation,motivation,motivation,,
33.63,36.57,hi everyone it's me lisa the budget equestrian,opening,opening,opening,,
36.62,41.81,welcome back to my channel and if this is your first time here welcome,opening,opening,opening,,
41.82,48.81,so last week i shared with you guys that i got some western tack that i'm going to be using primarily on ethan,tool,context,context,,
49.56,57.31,and one thing about the western saddles that is hard for me is that the stirrups face the same direction that the horses,context,context,context,,
57.44,62.17,they're not twisted out like that and when you're on the horse that's what you need them to be,context,context,context,,
62.52,68.64,so one solution to that is to get the fenders so that they turn out like that,context,context,context,,
69.41,79.36,one way you can do this is using a broomstick so you just take the broomstick and you put it through the stirrups,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
79.37,80.98,because that's how you're going to be on the horse,instruction,justification,justification,,
80.99,90.97,anyway yeah they'll be like that so you twist it through,context,context,context,,
90.98,103.08,maybe and that will help to keep your stirrups turned the direction that you want them to be,effect,effect,effect,,
103.33,104.19,o r,bridge,bridge,bridge,,
106.48,108.37,you can get these handy little things,tool,tool,tool,,
108.38,112.06,they're called stirrup turners and stirrup turners,tool,tool,tool,,
112.07,120.27,what you do is you put these connect these on through your stirrup and what that will do is keep your stirrup turned at a ninety degree angle to your horse,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,,
120.86,124.55,so it's kind of like the mdc strips that i have for my english saddle,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,,
124.68,126.87,but now i've got something for the western saddle too,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,,
127.92,131.96,but it's got these little tags on it and i don't really like the tag so those are coming off,instruction,status,instruction,,
133.19,136.12,and i also got some fancy stir up so i'm going to put those on too,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
137.33,,so the first thing you wanna do is got a disassemble the stirrup,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
,155.17,which is really hard on a new saddle that's not very expensive because of the weather is very stiff and it's hard to get a part,instruction,status,context,,
156.14,157.37,are you gonna take off the stirrup,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
157.38,157.97,hobbles,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
172.31,176.18,i think i'll oil it too while i'm out here because this leather is super stiff,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
179.13,183.38,western saddles are a lot more challenging than an english saddle in my opinion,context,context,context,,
184.79,186.64,ok so now we're gonna try to put this on,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,,
186.65,187.56,and then you stir up,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,,
195.32,196.21,this could be fun,side note,side note,side note,,
197.44,200.82,ok to put these on you'll need two pair of pliers,tool,tool,tool,,
202.12,208.86,one to hold with the bolt on the end and the other one to turn to the other side,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,,
217.07,218.53,so that's kind of a pain in the butt,side note,tool specification,context,,
222.93,223.78,but it's off,status,status,status,,
225.64,227.12,and it's got lots of hardware,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,,
227.17,229.46,lots of washers,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,,
231.11,232.54,i'm like a lock washer thing,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,,
239.88,254.84,ok so it's going to lay like this and then my stirrup is going to go that way,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
255.03,256.99,so this is how i want the stirrup to lay,status,context,status,,
257.43,260.29,so i've got to make this go under go through,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
273.16,274.45,i put that through there,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
278.09,279.08,they're there,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
284.77,296.33,this little guy the lock washer or whatever it's called the other washer or and then in the box,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
332.46,335.45,i wonder if it's like when you do an english stirrup leather,side note,side note,side note,,
335.52,339.56,checking it from your so that,side note,side note,side note,,
339.57,344.7,i might be a little bit long for me but we'll see,side note,side note,side note,,
345.02,346.97,so now i gotta put the stirrup hobble back on,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,,
347.04,350.99,but i'm going to oil it a little bit too because like i said it's really stiff,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
354.61,363.11,i don't want to waste my oil,side note,warning,side note,,
363.12,374.58,but and now my stirrup is back on,status,status,status,,
375.58,377.27,they're going to do to the other side,instruction,instruction,instruction,,
461,468.6,well it took awhile but i finally got it figured out and i'm pretty excited to see how it will be to ride in this saddle,status,status,status,,
468.9,474.3,with the stirrups like this i'm hoping it's gonna be just like my mdc stirrups,status,status,status,,
474.45,480.28,i'm pretty sure it will be because the stirrups are facing at a ninety degree angle,context,context,context,,
480.29,482.04,just like my other stirps do,context,context,context,,
482.12,484.18,so that will help my knees,context,context,context,,
484.31,489.68,that's one of the biggest benefits i found to having your stirrups face out like this all the time,context,context,context,,
489.79,494.8,especially if you have knee or ankle problems it will really help to alleviate that,context,context,context,,
494.89,497.62,i can speak from personal experience,side note,side note,side note,,
497.67,503.78,so if this is something that you've thought about doing but didn't know where to get them or didn't want to spend a lot of money,tip,tip,tip,,
503.95,508.84,i got these on amazon they're tough one and they were eight dollars and seventy nine cents,tip,tip,tip,,
509.09,515.48,so to me that's worth it just to even just to try to see if it's gonna work,tip,tip,tip,,
515.57,518.99,because like i said my mdc stirrups work great,tip,tip,tip,,
519.09,522.46,no knee pain so hopefully this will be the same,tip,tip,tip,,
