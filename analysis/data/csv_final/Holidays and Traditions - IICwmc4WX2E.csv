0.48,2.19,hello everyone it is zoe,opening,opening,opening,
2.2,6.67,and today i'm here to show you how to make an adorable tree bag for valentine's day,goal,goal,goal,
6.72,7.47,or any day,goal,goal,goal,
7.48,8.45,it doesn't matter,goal,goal,goal,
8.56,17.07,so the things you will need are a piece of paper and i'm using a paper that i was probably going to recycle anyway,tool,tool,tool,
17.14,19.21,so i'm reading this paper,tool specification,tool,tool specification,
19.32,23.07,and if you're a student and you're in school then you probably have a lot of these kinds of papers,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
23.08,24.49,so that's easy,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
24.92,34.17,and i'm also going to use a pair of scissors a glue stick some fancy tape or some regular tape,tool (multiple),tool (multiple),tool (multiple),
34.22,35.1,or some stickers,tool (multiple),tool (multiple),tool (multiple),
35.11,40.05,it doesn't really matter and of course some treats that i'm going to put in my treat bags,tool,tool,tool,
40.56,44.49,so the first thing you have to do is you have to use your scissors to cut your piece of paper in half,late instruction,late instruction,late instruction,
44.5,48.52,now i've already done this or you can use your hands and just hear it,late instruction (multiple),late instruction,late instruction (multiple),
49.56,51.99,so that's the first step,context,context,context,
52.04,58.09,and then the second thing you want to do is you want to fold your paper down in south,instruction,instruction,instruction,
59.04,67.69,it doesn't really matter what side you folded on you just want to fold it a little bit so it has a few,instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),
70.26,73.87,uh about one centimeter width so that you can glue down it,justification,justification,justification,
74.57,82.16,and actually i'm probably gonna fall down the side with the holes because i think that is the side that i want to hide,justification,justification,justification,
82.43,84.28,so i'm going to fold down the side with the holes,context,instruction,instruction,
84.67,87.62,and now i'm going to take my glue,instruction,instruction,instruction,
89.47,92.14,and i'm going to just glue down that whole side,instruction,instruction,instruction,
92.19,97.32,so this whole strip that i folded over i'm just going to apply lots of glue to it because you want it to stick,instruction,instruction,instruction,
97.33,101.96,you really want this piece to stick it's very important or else your whole bag falls apart,instruction,instruction,instruction,
102.11,105.9,and then after that you're going to take your other piece and you're going to go on top of it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
105.97,107.8,just folding the paper in half,instruction,instruction,instruction,
107.81,111.81,essentially you want to line it up very nicely,instruction,instruction,instruction,
111.82,116.55,you don't want it to be all you know bumpy or anything because you want this to look good,instruction,instruction,instruction,
116.56,122.25,probably you want whoever you're going to give it to to be like oh wow they put a lot of effort into this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
122.3,129.79,and then you're going to flatten out this end too so that it's very crisp and sharp,effect,instruction,instruction,
129.84,136.75,and as you noticed i probably i put the words of my paper on the inside because that's what i wanted to do,instruction,instruction,instruction,
136.76,139.47,if you want to put the words on the outside that's totally up to you,instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),instruction (multiple),
139.74,145.91,now what i'm going to do is i am going to fold up the bottom and it doesn't matter which side of the bottom,subgoal,instruction,subgoal,
145.92,147.42,i'm going to make this my bottom,context,instruction,context,
147.54,151.71,and ah for me i like to pull up about four lines about four or five lines,instruction,instruction,instruction,
151.92,154.93,so that's about here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
155.04,160.84,and if you're not using non line paper then that's probably about slightly more than an inch,instruction,instruction,instruction,
160.9,161.47,i believe,instruction,instruction,instruction,
162.31,163.36,and so you're going to unfold,instruction,instruction,instruction,
163.37,166.44,and this is like folding a very flat present,context,context,context,
166.49,168.74,so you're going to make the little triangles,instruction,instruction,instruction,
168.91,170.33,oh my hair got caught in that,side note,side note,side note,
172.19,175.96,and then you're going to make the triangles as if you're wrapping a present,instruction,instruction,instruction,
175.97,177.51,except this is a flat present,instruction,instruction,instruction,
179.03,184.45,so you want to make the triangles pretty much the same on both sides so it looks nice at the end,instruction,instruction,instruction,
184.46,185.5,and you're gonna take your glue now,instruction,instruction,instruction,
185.51,189.44,and you're going to glue on the right on the left and on the bottom,instruction,instruction,instruction,
189.49,191.91,but you're not going to glue on the top because you don't have to,instruction,instruction,instruction,
192.71,197.18,so the next step is you're going to take the top and you're going to fold it down south,instruction,instruction,instruction,
197.19,201.95,it goes slightly past the middle line so you are going to fold it down nicely,instruction,instruction,instruction,
201.96,202.81,like that and like,instruction,instruction,instruction,
202.82,209.15,so and then you're going to take the bottom half and you're going to do the same thing,instruction,instruction,instruction,
209.16,220.66,you're going to fold it up so that it covers the top half and here you might want to like pause for a second to really make sure that it's stuck,instruction,instruction,instruction,
220.67,225.54,it's sticks because sometimes i've done this and it just falls apart at the next step,justification,justification,justification,
225.55,227.98,so you wanna make sure it's very secure,instruction,instruction,instruction,
228.07,232.04,in fact you can even add a piece of tape to make sure it's secure,tip,instruction,tip,
232.05,234.62,i'm not going to do that now but if you want to you could,tip,instruction,tip,
235.03,238.12,now the next step is you just want to pop open your bag,subgoal,bridge,subgoal,
238.13,240.9,so using your hand do this very gently,instruction,instruction,instruction,
240.95,244.5,once again so the bottom doesn't burst open,instruction,context,justification,
,,and you're going to pop it open,instruction,instruction,instruction,
244.51,245.75,so it's three mentioned on,instruction,instruction,instruction,
245.76,248.42,it can stand on its own like this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
248.65,257.39,so at this point you can fill it with the candy and you're basically done with the assembly of it so i can put my candy in here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
258.13,265.65,and i can prepare it to give to whoever i want to give it to you so you can now close it up,instruction,justification,instruction,
266.02,268.47,some people like to cut really cute designs at the top,instruction (optional),tip,instruction (optional),
268.52,276.11,i don't really have one of those whole punch machines right now to cut those so i'm just going to fold it down and the best as i can,instruction,instruction,instruction,
276.98,279.77,don't put any hair in there because that's kind of weird,side note,side note,side note,
280.56,282.81,my hair is is getting everywhere today huh,side note,side note,side note,
283.08,286.84,and what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my tape,instruction,instruction,instruction,
286.88,293.36,let's take a little good piece of it and i'm just going to stick it on right there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
293.43,296.24,i'm whoops,side note,filler,filler,
301.94,303.59,so this is my feedback,status,context,status,
303.66,310.01,and if you wanted to do something extra you can do is you can take a little marker and you can just write two,instruction (optional),instruction,instruction (optional),
310.02,325.86,and from you know if you want to do that so you can write two you you from me me too,instruction (optional),instruction,instruction (optional),
329.46,336.37,so that's just another idea if you are making this for valentine's day or if you just want to give someone a gift in a cute little bag,outcome,context,reflection,
