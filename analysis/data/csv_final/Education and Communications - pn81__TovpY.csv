0.7,1.23,hi there,opening,opening,opening,
1.24,6.37,my name is nils from diy nails dot com and in this video i'm going to be showing you how to build a huge,opening,opening,opening,
6.38,19.5,high quality projector screen for about a hundred dollars for this project,goal,goal,goal,
19.51,24.08,i'm working at my buddy's house where he's got a projector all ready to go and he just needs a screen for it,context,context,context,
24.19,29.38,so we started out by projecting the full size of the image onto the wall where the screen is going to go,instruction,instruction,instruction,
29.63,35.34,we made sure everything was plumb and straight so that we can get a nice rectangle and then we went ahead and grabbed our measurements,instruction,instruction,instruction,
35.51,43.08,we went and got the diagonal measurement for bragging rights to say how big the screen is then the horizontal and the vertical measurements for this project,instruction,instruction,instruction,
43.16,48.7,all we really need as far as material are one by fours and they'll typically come either pre primed or unfinished,tool,tool,tool,
48.71,50.32,but it doesn't really matter which you get,tool (multiple),tool,tool (multiple),
51.03,53.64,here's how to figure out how much material you're going to need,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
53.7,60.86,you're going to have a top and bottom rail each of which will be at the full width and then your sides and your two supports will be at the full height,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
60.93,66.16,minus the width of the top and the bottom which would be seven inches if you're using one by four material,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
66.83,70.34,once you have the material measure out and cut each piece,instruction,instruction,instruction,
83.41,85.86,as far as assembly you've got a bunch of options,subgoal,context,context,
85.91,93.07,the two i want to show here are using corner braces and metal braces like you see here or using a pocket hole system,context,tool,context,
93.13,95.36,which is what i'm using to build this frame,context,tool,context,
96.05,100.1,we're going to add two pocket holes to the ends of each of the vertical pieces,instruction,instruction,instruction,
100.11,102.42,we don't need any in the top or bottom rail,instruction,instruction,instruction,
102.85,104.84,pocket hole system start at about forty,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
105.01,111.76,for the simplest version the system you see in this video is the k four pocket hole system and that one runs about ninety five dollars,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
112.18,119.32,they have a deluxe version for about a hundred and fifty five dollars but i'll include links for all of the products i've mentioned in the description below,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
121.51,129.85,next take your boards down to the room that you're going to be mounting the screen on it ,instruction,instruction,instruction,
,,so that you don't have to carry a fully assembled screen through doors which may or may not work,justification,justification,justification,
129.89,138,lay out each of the pieces and then mark at the one third and two thirds point of your top and bottom rails so that you can put your support rails in place,instruction,instruction,instruction,
140.32,144.69,the most important part on this next step is making sure the face is nice and flat,instruction,instruction,instruction,
144.8,151.4,check to be sure that the pieces you're lining up are flush with one another so that you don't end up with a lip where you don't want it here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
151.41,156.73,i'm using a craig right angle clamp and i promise i'm not getting sponsored or paid to mention craig or anything like that,tool,tool,tool,
156.74,160.39,it's just that they actually do have a pretty awesome tools that i use for most of my projects,side note,side note,side note,
161.43,165.92,if you're assembling your frame with braces make sure you're using counter sink screws,tool,tool,tool,
165.93,170.88,and make sure they're short enough that they don't pierce through the other side of the material again,instruction,instruction,instruction,
170.89,175.68,as you're assembling this just make sure that all of your pieces are nice and flush it and you'll end up with a great looking product,instruction,instruction,instruction,
175.69,184.56,when you're done once the frame is assembled move it out of the way and then lay out your screen material,instruction,instruction,instruction,
184.65,187.4,i'm using carl's flexi gray projector screen material,tool,tool,tool,
187.41,190.78,i've used this twice so far in projector screens and the stuff is awesome,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
190.95,196.14,it's got a nice flexible backing kind of like rubber so that when you stretch the material over the frame,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
196.19,199.95,it's actually pretty difficult to end up with any creases or wrinkles in the material,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
200.87,206.1,i called a friend of mine who runs a home theater installation business and he told me that the gray gives you a really nice picture,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
206.11,208.16,even if you're not in a pitch black environment,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
208.23,213.54,and after having built two screens i have to agree this stuff works really well even if there is some ambient light around,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
213.61,217.93,of course the projector and the contrast ratio of your projector make a big difference there as well,tool specification,tool specification,tool specification,
221.51,227.33,to finish up the screen we're going to use a staple gun and we're going to place staples about every two inches or so,instruction,justification,instruction,
227.39,231.15,i like to use a lot of staples so that i'm not putting a lot of tension on any one spot,justification,instruction,justification,
232.1,239.46,choose a corner to start in and then work your way around the screen making sure that you pull the screen nice and tall all the way along as you go,instruction,instruction,instruction,
240.25,244.64,like i mentioned earlier some screen materials make it really easy to do a good job with this,tip,tip,tip,
244.69,254.78,just make sure you keep an eye on it at all times as you're stapling it down so you don't accidentally end up with some wrinkles or creases in the screen when you're on the last section,tip,tip,tip,
254.83,257.9,again just make sure it's nice and tight and you'll be good to go,instruction,instruction,instruction,
259.21,263.16,when you get to the corner just fold the material in on itself and staple it down,instruction,instruction,instruction,
263.23,266.9,that way you don't end up with any ugly material sticking out from the outside of the screen,instruction,effect,effect,
269.17,272.27,once you finished assembling the screen it's time to get ready to hang it,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
273.13,276.4,we can then make the marks for where the corners of the projector screen,instruction,instruction,instruction,
276.41,280.2,i ought to go to make sure that the actual image is centered on the screen,instruction,instruction,instruction,
281.04,290.25,next we're going to use a stud finder to mark where the studs are and we're going to drive at least two screws into the top of about three and a half inches down from where it needs to go,instruction,instruction,instruction,
290.29,294.28,that way when we hang the screen it's going to sit exactly where we want it to be,effect,effect,effect,
294.66,300.08,leave the screws protruding out about a half inch from the wall which is less than the thickness of the frame,instruction,instruction,instruction,
301.11,308.26,finally we hang the screen and check out what an awesome picture it creates just like in all my videos,instruction,instruction,instruction,
