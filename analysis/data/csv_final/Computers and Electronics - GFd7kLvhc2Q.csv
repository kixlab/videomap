5.86,6.45,hello guys,opening,opening,opening,
6.46,7.71,welcome to take me devoted,opening,opening,opening,
7.72,12.17,in this video we will write a program to convert binary number to decimal number,goal,goal,goal,
12.48,14.51,so let's start,bridge,bridge,bridge,
14.84,16.29,so what do we need to do,bridge,bridge,bridge,
16.3,24.71,suppose we have one binary number like this we have to convert is equivalent decimal number,context,context,context,
24.96,26.49,so how to do that,context,context,context,
28.36,35.49,so so yeah it's alright just make function,instruction,instruction,instruction,
37.13,47.03,ok so let's write a method to get binary to decimal so i will take public int met,instruction,instruction,instruction,
47.04,51.32,the name will be like binary to to see,instruction,instruction,instruction,
52.92,59.69,oh ok it will take in the binder,instruction,instruction,instruction,
62.55,78.25,no what we will do we will take a look while it is true and then we'll check if this number is zero,instruction,instruction,instruction,
78.8,82.19,if it will be zero we will break here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
83.55,87.31,ok no no,instruction,instruction,instruction,
87.46,91.92,if else in else part what will we write,instruction,instruction,instruction,
95.19,104.81,we know that how to calculate uh decimal value from a binary number we have to uh take base as a two,context,context,context,
104.86,109.72,then we have to take the power uh from zero to north minus one,context,context,context,
109.73,114.88,whatever the value of this suppose first is uh uh,context,context,context,
114.89,124.71,zero one into two to the power one two three four two to the fourth then one in two two,context,context,context,
124.72,130.06,two three zero one two two two or two one into two tower and one into two two four zero,context,context,context,
130.37,131.25,from zero to one,context,context,context,
131.26,131.88,minus one,context,context,context,
132.05,133.98,so we will do here,bridge,bridge,bridge,
134.05,140.7,we will take one temporary variable and here we will find the digit ok,instruction,instruction,instruction,
140.83,141.88,or to fund the digit,instruction,instruction,instruction,
142.62,145.29,what's in title of producing percentile,instruction,instruction,instruction,
145.3,147.08,ok we'll get the digit,context,instruction,context,
147.19,148.28,now what we will do,subgoal,context,bridge,
149.28,151.33,we have to write the decimal one,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
151.38,164.37,before that we have to uh do damp into do we have a math class and we use power,instruction,subgoal,instruction,
164.44,167.07,ok now we have to,instruction,subgoal,instruction,
167.62,174.56,uh what will be the aa will be two and b will be some power value,instruction,instruction,instruction,
174.82,176.62,ok power,instruction,instruction,instruction,
177.41,183.34,ok now we have to explicitly define this power variable here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
183.41,185.23,so let's say int,instruction,instruction,instruction,
186.34,189.09,power is equal to take zero,instruction,instruction,instruction,
189.32,197.21,ok now now what we have to do here we uh now,instruction,instruction,instruction,
197.22,206.46,after that we have to take we need to require ten k no no this is done,instruction,instruction,instruction,
206.53,207.66,now we have to,instruction,instruction,instruction,
207.71,210.88,this power should be incremented,instruction,instruction,instruction,
210.99,213.06,ok and treatment,instruction,instruction,instruction,
213.83,215.46,so you have done this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
215.75,218.7,and after that we will return decimal value,instruction,instruction,instruction,
218.71,223.02,so we have to store this one into uh some uh,instruction,instruction,instruction,
223.03,223.64,variable,instruction,instruction,instruction,
223.69,229.68,so let's say here in decimal which is equal to zero,instruction,instruction,instruction,
230.03,231.13,now we will,instruction,instruction,instruction,
231.81,233.13,what do you do here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
233.36,240.23,we will write this equal to ok then,instruction,instruction,instruction,
241.94,252.24,so in this way where the story uh we are finding the values of decimal values and we used to store in this variable,status,effect,effect,
252.25,259.68,after this loop we will get uh the equivalent decimal number of this binary number,status,effect,effect,
259.69,275.55,ok now we have to return this this email here this is our loop and then ok return this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
277.88,278.37,done,status,status,status,
278.54,279.65,now what we need to do,instruction,subgoal,subgoal,
279.66,281.77,we need to call this function from here,instruction,subgoal,subgoal,
281.84,288.82,so let's let's create object of this because we haven't made,instruction,instruction,instruction,
288.83,289.76,this is static,instruction,instruction,instruction,
290.38,295.63,so let's create do do you,instruction,instruction,instruction,
298.49,304.89,ok no we have to call this function's dot,instruction,instruction,instruction,
306.78,308.55,when did it two decimal,instruction,instruction,instruction,
308.62,313.03,now we can pass whatever the value you want,instruction,instruction,instruction,
313.32,318.8,i want to us one one one ok one one one,instruction,context,instruction,
319.76,330.72,we have watched it and now we will bring this value as well ,instruction,instruction,instruction,
,,so that we are able to see in this,justification,justification,justification,
332.37,339.48,yeah it's like something that uh what,status,context,side note,
339.63,340.84,the one one one,instruction,context,instruction,
341.87,344.74,so it will give you the decimal value of this,instruction,instruction,instruction,
344.81,347.86,ok so done,instruction,status,status,
348.07,367.72,so we can write some for some more values necessary to do on the zero one zero,instruction,instruction,instruction,
370.28,374.96,that's right do you know anything,instruction,instruction,instruction,
375.01,381.25,whatever you want to or whatever you want to give the input it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
386.04,386.9,so we've done,bridge,outcome,outcome,
387.2,393.76,this is the code to convert binary number to decimal number formatted,status,outcome,outcome,
394.92,397.64,and and let's run this example,instruction,outcome,instruction,
399.89,402.48,so let's see triple one seven,outcome,outcome,outcome,
402.63,404.12,we can calculate manually,outcome,outcome,outcome,
404.13,409.5,also two to the power two is uh four four plus two,outcome,outcome,outcome,
409.55,411.28,six plus one is seven,outcome,outcome,outcome,
411.59,412.72,then this is ten,outcome,outcome,outcome,
412.87,414.18,this is seventy four,outcome,outcome,outcome,
414.29,418.88,in this way we can calculate binary values,outcome,outcome,outcome,
419.27,423.16,we can convert binary values to decimal number,outcome,outcome,outcome,
423.17,425.95,equivalent equivalent decimal number,outcome,outcome,outcome,
426.11,428.26,so guys thanks so much,closing,closing,closing,
428.98,430.05,i hope this is helpful,closing,closing,closing,
437.13,437.15,k,closing,closing,closing,
