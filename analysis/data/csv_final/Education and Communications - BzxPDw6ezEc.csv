3.2,4.89,hello there and welcome this video,opening,opening,opening,
4.9,9.12,we're gonna talk about why ponds green and how to cure that problem,goal,goal,goal,
10.34,17.5,so this time of year when the sun comes out and the fish start feeding most people with ponds go a horrible green color,motivation,motivation,motivation,
18.19,22.62,you can't see the fish and it's disappointing for everybody involved,motivation,motivation,motivation,
23.93,25.44,what makes your pond go green,context,context,context,
25.51,31.46,well when the sun starts shining down it's providing a source of light for the algae,context,context,context,
31.57,35.57,and algae are photosynthetic organism and obviously more light,context,context,context,
35.58,36.92,will it cause more growth,context,context,context,
37.7,40.15,but to grow it will also need food,context,context,context,
40.68,46.54,at this time of year the fish will start waking up and start feeding and you're obviously going to start giving them the food,context,context,context,
47.78,55.25,when fish feed they will also poo and poo is going to come out of them and it's going to create a source of nitrates and phosphates,context,context,context,
55.68,61.13,and nitrates and phosphates is the first riser that the algae needs in addition to the sunlight to grow,context,context,context,
61.46,64.31,so there we have the main reasons why your pond will go green,context,context,context,
64.96,66.6,sunlight and food,context,context,context,
67.42,72.97,now there's not a whole lot you can do about this other than covering your pond up or starving your fish,context,context,context,
73.36,75.13,neither of which you really want to do,context,context,context,
76.7,79.71,so what's the solution to green pond water,context,context,context,
80.02,87.21,well let's go through the three ways that you can make your pond water go clear and you don't have to use all three of these,briefing,briefing,briefing,
87.22,93.49,you can use any one of them or in any combination that you like and they can all be effective on their own,briefing,briefing,briefing,
94.46,105.33,so the first way of making your pond clear is to add a filter with a uv or to add a u v as a standalone edition to a filter that's already present in your pond,instruction,subgoal,subgoal,
105.8,109.11,so uv light is basically exactly what it sounds like,tool,context,tool,
109.12,111.89,it's a tube that emits uv radiation,tool specification,context,tool specification,
112.64,117.77,now uv radiation or uv light is particularly bad for living organisms,context,context,context,
117.9,123.84,so the way uv light works is the water from the pond will flow through it get hit by a dose of uv light,context,context,context,
124.55,128.3,and that will kill the floating algae within your pond,context,context,context,
129.17,135.7,it will then be taken out normally by some filter media within your filter and out will come clean water,context,context,context,
137.14,142.37,do this for long enough and you're pond will become a clear paradise for your fish,instruction,instruction,instruction,
142.68,147.75,the only drawback to using a uv light is you will need to change the bulb every year at the start of the season,context,context,context,
147.76,149.67,preferably and that is an added cost,context,context,context,
150.11,152.89,however they are very effective at doing their job,context,context,context,
153.18,155.31,the second way to make your ponder crystal clear,instruction,subgoal,subgoal,
155.56,156.79,like to use chemicals,instruction,subgoal,subgoal,
157.26,164.16,now i'm not a huge fan of chemicals being put into ponds however they can be useful in their own way,side note,side note,side note,
166.15,169.76,one of the more natural ways of clearing upon this to use a thing called barley straw,context,context,context,
170.44,171.65,now it is exactly that,context,context,context,
171.66,174.83,it's just barley straw in a bale that you're throwing your point at the start of the year,context,context,context,
174.9,179.95,as it rots it releases hydrogen peroxide and that will kill the algae in the pond,context,context,context,
180.06,183.17,it will also kill blanket weed so it's a bit of a double edged sword,context,context,context,
184.65,190.45,there's no real drawbacks to using barley straw and many large government agencies use it as well,context,context,context,
190.58,197.98,other chemicals available are potent algicides which target floating algae in particular and also ones that are flocculants,context,context,context,
197.99,205.68,which basically mean the algae will stick together fourth spot on the pond or be taken into the filter and removed by the sponges,context,context,context,
207.68,214.97,the drawback to both of these chemicals is that they only work for a short period of time and they don't stop the algi coming back,context,context,context,
215.03,217.34,so you have to keep using them if you want to keep your pond clear,context,context,context,
218.17,222.16,also some are more effective than others and how many are generally quite expensive,context,context,context,
223.22,231.06,the third way of creating crystal clear pond water is to remove the food available for the algae even if there's plentiful sunlight,instruction,subgoal,subgoal,
231.07,233.78,even on days like today there's no food for the algae,context,context,context,
233.95,237.08,there won't be any algae so how would you do that,context,context,context,
237.33,245.56,well this is the most natural method and also i feel the best looking and that is to add lots of plants to your pond,context,context,context,
246.37,248.92,now as you can see this pond is actually pretty small,status,status,status,
248.93,250.34,it's about five hundred liters,status,status,status,
250.91,252.82,it's probably slightly overstocked,status,status,status,
253.52,260.38,however the water is crystal clear and that's because there are many plants in this pond,status,status,status,
263.43,274.1,now all of these plants will be sucking out nutrients from this water and that means all the pool and all the food goes into the pond won't get converted into aldi,context,context,context,
274.53,279.08,they get converted into red flowers which is just the way i like it,context,context,context,
293.02,306.68,the best plants to plant in your pond are reeds like these and irises because these are the most effective at removing nitrates and phosphates from the pond water,instruction,tool,tool,
307.03,315.68,how about any plants will do the job as long as there are a lot of them,instruction (multiple),tool (optional),tool (multiple),
,,now i personally prefer the planted roots to clear water,reflection,reflection,reflection,
315.75,318.5,however any of the three i've mentioned will work just fine,instruction (multiple),reflection,reflection,
320.55,328.38,i would recommend if you're going to use any of the two to use the plants and the u v roof because that will give you crystal clear water pretty quickly,tip,reflection,reflection,
