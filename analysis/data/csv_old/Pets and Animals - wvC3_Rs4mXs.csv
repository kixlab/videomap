19.11,25.42,if you've ever felt like you can't ride without bouncing all over the place then i hope you're going to enjoy this video,opening,opening,opening,
25.49,27.38,so i'm calling from crkt training,opening,opening,opening,
27.39,35.26,you're watching my weekly video show where i posted a video on a horse training and riding or a horse care topic every week,opening,opening,opening,
35.79,46.92,and one of the one of the most common questions that i get of when i meet people or that people send to me an email is about how do i stop bouncing and it goes from,context,motivation,motivation,definition of motivation
46.99,51.39,if you're a beginner rider and you feel like right now can't ride the trot,context,motivation,motivation,
51.4,58.49,or you're learning to ride the canner and you just can't ride those gates without feeling like you're bouncing and you're hitting the horses back,context,motivation,motivation,
58.54,62.71,or even if you're a more experienced rider and that balance is a little bit more subtle,context,motivation,motivation,
62.72,67.3,maybe you just feel it now and then in a transition where you know that you're getting a little jarred,context,motivation,motivation,
67.31,69.89,you're getting a little bit of out of sync with your horse,context,motivation,motivation,
69.9,72.65,or maybe it's during a lead change or after a jump,context,motivation,motivation,
73.12,82.91,so i've found that riding is really an art of going with movement and as we progress as a rider,context,context,context,
82.98,96.09,we can start to actually initiate good movement but when we're having trouble with with bouncing it usually comes from excess tension or bracing somewhere in our body,context,context,context,
96.16,102.79,so if i start walking here on big boy so this is big boy he's a horse that i have here at my farm in training,tool,tool,tool,
102.88,111.02,and i'm using him deliberately in today's video because big boy was only started under saddle a few months ago,tool,tool,tool,
111.12,119.83,and one of the things that i like to make sure i do with young horses that i'm starting is to not always ride them perfectly,instruction,instruction,instruction,
119.84,125.8,so we when i'm starting a young horse it's good to spend most of the time riding them very well,instruction,instruction,instruction,
125.81,132.05,meaning in good balance teaching the horse that he can be very comfortable and move well under a rider,justification,effect,effect,
132.09,138.55,but there's also times that i want to demonstrate what i'm going to do for you today and bounce a little bit on their back,instruction,instruction,instruction,
138.56,143.96,hit their back a little bit harder than i ideally want to just,justification,instruction,instruction,
,,so that they get used to that,justification,justification,justification,
144.03,147.94,and they don't find it as a a scary experience the first time,justification,justification,justification,
147.95,151.66,it happens with maybe their owner or with a different rider,justification,justification,justification,
154.24,164.19,so if i ask a big boy for a trot here and he's a pretty big moving horse so he can,instruction,instruction,instruction,
164.64,170.69,he can create a lot of bounce if i start to brace so there's lots of different places we can tense up in our body,instruction,instruction,instruction,
170.74,176.9,if i start to jam my heels down then all of a sudden the movement gets a lot harder,instruction,instruction,instruction,
176.97,182.72,big boy wants to stop and i can feel like i start to hit his back with each stride,effect,effect,effect,
183.51,187.66,so if we're doing a sitting trot we want the sitting trot to be able to feel soft,instruction,instruction,instruction,
187.73,189.18,even on a big moving horse,instruction,instruction,instruction,
189.19,194.46,like big boy we want to feel like we're going up and down with the movement instead of bouncing,instruction,instruction,instruction,
194.53,202.1,but if i start to tighten almost any part of my body for example if i grip here with my legs to try to hold myself on,instruction,warning,context,
202.45,210.1,you can see i start popping right out of the saddle and it becomes uncomfortable for both of us to keep going,effect,warning,context,
210.37,212.88,so that brace can happen a lot of different places,context,warning,context,
212.95,220.08,the most common places that i see it when riders are complaining of bouncing is either bracing into the heels,context,context,context,
220.17,225.44,so trying to really push on to the stirrups and almost lift themselves out of the saddle slightly,context,context,context,
226.03,228.24,or gripping through the legs,context,context,context,
228.31,234.32,so in an effort to try to hold themselves in and stop the bounce they actually create more of it,context,context,context,
234.83,238.42,or i see it just by getting really tight in the big glutes,context,context,context,
238.59,243.85,so when we think about muscle when we make our house our muscle hard and tight,instruction,context,context,
244.11,245.68,hard muscle bounces,instruction,context,context,
245.73,255.88,so if i squeeze my glutes up trying to hold myself into the saddle i actually make two basically big balls of muscle that are going to make me start bouncing,effect,status,context,
255.99,257.25,and this is true again,context,status,context,
257.26,273.25,whether we're doing trot whether we're doing canner whether we're working on improving the way that we ride through a transition or a lead change is when we can get everything soft and going with the horse,context,context,context,
273.32,277.08,we're going to be able to stop that bouncing feeling,context,context,context,
278.12,283.49,i tacked up noel to be able to show you the canter because big boys still pretty green at the canter,tool,tool,tool,
283.54,295.75,but the same concept applies when we canner that if you experience bouncing at the canner it's most likely because your accidentally bracing or getting tense somewhere,instruction,instruction,instruction,
296.36,304.87,at the kenner we also want to feel like we're moving our with our horse and that we can stay seated in the saddle or even in a light seat,instruction,instruction,instruction,
304.88,307.14,but not feeling like we're slapping the saddle,instruction,instruction,instruction,
307.34,313.34,but if i start to tense here noel if i start to push my heels down and group with my leg,instruction,warning,warning,not context!
313.43,317.66,you can see that immediately i start kind of flying out of the saddle,effect,warning,warning,
317.97,328.56,now if i go back and reset and let my leg get soft again but now if i think about gripping with my butt to try to hold myself in again,instruction,warning,warning,
328.57,333.86,you can see as soon as i get tight back here i start popping right out of the saddle,effect,warning,warning,
334.23,337.04,and it can even happen with tightness in her upper body,instruction,warning,warning,
337.09,346.65,so if i think about keeping my lower body as soft as i can but i pull my shoulders up and i get tight and my shoulders again,instruction,instruction,instruction,
347.24,351.81,i start to feel like i'm bouncing and like i'm coming right out of the saddle,effect,status,status,
352.9,355.17,there are several reasons why we grip,context,context,context,
355.18,358.67,sometimes we grip because we're simply out of alignment,context,context,context,
358.72,363.59,so if we are leaning too far back we're leaning too far forward,context,context,context,
363.6,367.52,if we've got our legs in front of us and we don't have a good alignment through our body,context,context,context,
367.59,373.58,we can end up getting tight are getting tense different places in order to try to hold us on the horse,context,context,context,
373.67,376.47,and it help us feel like we're in better balance,context,context,context,
377.36,384.45,we also sometimes grip when we are just new to learning and movement so if a movement is new and unfamiliar,context,context,context,
384.46,389.27,if it starts to trigger a bit of a stress response in us we go to start clamping,context,context,context,
389.28,393.14,hunkering down and holding on instead of going with the movement,context,context,context,
393.28,395.69,so you want to make sure that you've got a good alignment,instruction,instruction,instruction,
395.76,399.63,and you also want to make sure that you're working at a pace that's comfortable for you,instruction,instruction,instruction,
399.68,402.01,so that you're challenging your comfort level,instruction,instruction,instruction,
402.14,412.45,but you're not pushing so hard so fast that you don't even have the time to to be able to think through and have a little more awareness of your body as you're riding,instruction,instruction,instruction,
412.46,417.93,so if you've really struggling at the canner maybe it's time to go back and work a little bit at the sitting trot,instruction,instruction,instruction,
418,425.63,or maybe it's time to just go back and work on those canter transitions before you start trying to go back to riding your canner figure eight,instruction,instruction,instruction,
426.16,431.07,now it's time for you to take this information and put it in action for yourself,closing,instruction,closing,
431.18,439.01,so leave me a comment and just tell me one place where you're aware that you might get a little bit tense when you're riding,self-promo,closing,side note,not self-promo
