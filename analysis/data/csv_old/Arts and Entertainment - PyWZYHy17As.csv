0.18,1.25,hey what's up you guys,opening,opening,opening,
1.26,3.38,marty schwartz here with marty music,opening,opening,opening,
3.42,5.75,thanks for hanging out for another gear thursday video,opening,opening,opening,
5.89,12.29,i was really excited to partner with reverb and bring you that video last week talking about picking out your first acoustic,external resource,side note,side note,
12.34,15.03,now we're talking about taking care of that acoustic,goal,side note,goal,
15.04,21.53,and i want to remind you guys that reverb is giving away five hundred dollars in reverb bucks to one of my subscribers,side note,side note,side note,
21.58,24.37,i got a link for the giveaway in the first comment below,side note,side note,side note,
24.38,26.83,now let's talk about taking care of your first acoustic,bridge,goal,bridge,
26.88,27.23,all right,filler,bridge,bridge,
27.24,28.22,so first things first,subgoal,bridge,bridge,
28.23,30.33,we want to keep the guitar clean,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,
30.83,32.44,there's a lot of different ways to do it,instruction,subgoal,subgoal,
32.45,35.48,a home remedy could be some warm water with a washcloth,instruction,instruction,instruction,
35.79,38.38,you could use some good old fashioned elbow grease,instruction,instruction,instruction,
38.43,43.96,what i prefer is a store bought solution that's a cleaner and polish in one,instruction (multiple),tool,tool,
44.01,47.24,they're really easy to find a lot of different brands out there to to pick from,justification,tool,tool,
47.49,52.64,you spray it on you wipe it down you don't leave any residue on and you should be good to go,justification,instruction,instruction,
52.69,58.98,it's really important to get the gunk off the neck too because there's different oils that secrete from our hands that can damage the wood with time,instruction,instruction,instruction,
59.13,63.44,i don't know what climate you're living in but it can really affect an acoustic instrument when you think about it,subgoal,context,context,
63.45,68.86,like when something's too humid would can swell and when it's too dry wood can crack,context,context,context,
68.92,74.19,now you probably walked into a music store and gone into the back room where all the fancy acoustics are,context,context,context,
74.26,78.93,and that back room is not just so you can hear your guitar over all the metal heads and the other room,context,context,context,
78.98,81.01,but it's actually for climate control,context,context,context,
81.06,81.27,now,context,context,context,
81.28,87.83,imagine you're like me and we don't have some giant climate controlled room that keeps our guitars at the perfect humidity level,context,context,context,
87.88,90.17,but there's a very easy solution for it,bridge,context,context,
90.18,92.55,and it's what i've used for years and years and years,bridge,context,context,
92.63,97.17,in fact this guitar is as old as me and i've been using it on this guitar as long as they've existed,side note,context,context,
97.18,98.83,and they're called humid apacs,tool,tool,tool,
99.12,100.65,and it's real simple,tool,tool,tool,
100.92,107.2,there's these replaceable little pouches that you put in the sound hole and you put in the neck of the guitar case,tool,tool,tool,
107.21,109.03,and you have to keep it in the guitar case,instruction,tool,tool,
109.12,114.17,and so if the environment is too humid those humidity packs will actually dry it up and vice versa,tool,tool,tool,
114.29,116.83,when it's too dry it will add the proper humidity,tool,tool,tool,
116.9,118.01,plus you don't have to check,tool,tool,tool,
118.02,120.87,like different ph levels and temperature levels,tool,tool,tool,
120.94,125.72,it's going to be a simple way to keep the guitar in tip top shape,instruction,effect,context,
125.76,130.96,now the humidity packs are designed for the guitar to be in its case but it will work with the gig bag as well,instruction,tool,tool,
131.05,134.62,and we want to keep it in that gig bag or case to protect it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
134.63,137.32,we want to protect our baby right,side note,instruction,justification,
137.49,143.66,another tip if you have a guitar strap don't keep it on the guitar in the case because it can ruin the finish,instruction,tip,warning,
143.73,144.7,so keep that outside,instruction,tip,instruction,
144.71,150.98,when you're not playing it about once or twice a year you're also going to want to lubricate these tuners as well as the nut,instruction,instruction,instruction,
151.05,155.43,now the nut is this little piece right here that the strings slot through,context,status,status,
155.48,161.85,now between the tuners and the nutbeam properly lubricated the guitar is going to stay in tune much better,effect,effect,effect,
161.9,167.11,alright so they're eventually comes a time where you're going to need to put new strings on the guitar,subgoal,context,context,
167.16,171.81,i tend to do it about every three months or so but basically when the string start to darken,instruction,context,context,
171.82,173.05,get a little gunky,instruction,context,context,
173.14,176.15,the guitar is not sounding as bright and vibrant,instruction,context,context,
176.2,178.37,you're gonna need to put some new strings on,instruction,context,context,
178.74,181.61,a great tool for that is one of these string winders,tool,tool,tool,
181.66,185.6,and this one's particularly cool because it's a winder string cutter,tool,tool,tool,
185.67,190.38,and then also there's a little groove right here that helps pull the pin out of the bridge,tool,tool,tool,
190.39,195.48,now when i change strings on the guitar i replace one string at a time,instruction,justification,instruction,
,,because of the tension on the neck,justification,justification,justification,
195.49,198.84,and the body stays relatively the same which is just good for the guitar,justification,effect,effect,
198.93,204.32,now there are instances where you take all the strings off and that may be when you want to clean the fret board,instruction,status,context,
204.33,207.66,but we're going to just take this first string and i'm going to loosen the string,instruction,instruction,instruction,
207.71,209.3,loosen the tension way down,instruction,instruction,instruction,
211.9,217.71,yeah you have to unwind it all the way off the peg but just nice and loose right then,instruction,instruction,instruction,
217.72,220.34,with the same tool i'm just going to cut,instruction,instruction,instruction,
220.35,222.41,you know somewhere around the middle's no big deal,instruction,instruction,instruction,
222.48,228.59,there's no exact science but you want that string loose so it doesn't come and whack you in the face,instruction,instruction,instruction,
228.9,230.53,and you don't want to learn that the hard way,context,context,context,
230.6,237.77,so then i just unwind the string off throw it in the ground so i can step on it with the other legos that are down there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
237.82,239.75,and then this pin right here,instruction,instruction,instruction,
240.02,246.19,we're going to use this tool and the groove goes right underneath and you just can pull it right up and bam,instruction,instruction,instruction,
246.26,246.71,it's bridge pin comes right out,effect,effect,effect,
246.72,251.2, and i dropped it and you pull the string out,instruction,instruction,instruction,
251.21,253.75,you throw that on the ground so you can step on that in the middle of the night,side note,side note,side note,
253.8,254.12,all right,filler,bridge,bridge,
254.13,260.35,now i have a fresh string and in the end there's a little metal ball that's going to go into this hole here in the bridge,instruction,instruction,instruction,
261,264.03,and then the pin that i was talking about that we pulled out,instruction,instruction,instruction,
264.26,271.92,it has a little groove on one side of it and the groove is meant for the string to fit right into it,instruction,instruction,instruction,
272.62,279.25,o what you want to do is you put the ball into the bridge right there and then with the groove facing the string,instruction,instruction,instruction,
279.6,280.81,you put the pin in,instruction,instruction,instruction,
280.92,282.11,so i'm pushing the pin in,instruction,instruction,instruction,
282.12,286.61,as i'm pulling the string pushing down pulling the string out so it's nice and tight,instruction,instruction,instruction,
286.65,287.27,right,instruction,instruction,instruction,
288.18,296.15,then you're going to thread it through this tuning peg here and then it just fits right in the hole,instruction,instruction,instruction,
297.82,303.17,and you can start by pulling it all the way through but you're actually going to want some slack,instruction,instruction,instruction,
303.22,304.18,how much slack,instruction,instruction,instruction,
304.19,312.17,well there's not an exact science but you'd like to be able to wrap the string around the tuner three or four times,instruction,instruction,instruction,
312.22,318.61,so what i tend to do is i pull it all the way and then i would press a finger down right here,tip,instruction,tip,
318.94,325.03,and then my other finger up and however much tension that is is usually about the right amount like that,tip,instruction,tip,
325.1,329.91,i'm going to press down on the string and then with my thumb find it and other fingers,instruction,instruction,instruction,
329.92,335.14,i'm just pulling up just enough so it's i don't know an inch and a half off the fret board there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
336.65,341.26,and so i'm just going to press down south that the rap is nice and tight right there,instruction,instruction,instruction,
341.45,349.11,i take this and then we just start wrapping up,instruction,instruction,instruction,
350.44,358.01,another good tip if you're a beginner and you're doing this doing one string at a time helps you visualize the direction that the other strings are wound in,tip,tip,tip,
358.06,361.52,next thing you're going to pull pull on that,instruction,instruction,instruction,
361.9,367.61,you're also going to come back here and press down make sure the pin is down pull on that,instruction,instruction,instruction,
367.62,368.68,and then tune again,instruction,instruction,instruction,
370.97,373.54,now what i recommend is you clip these at the very end,tip,tip,tip,
373.55,378.18,after the whole guitars restrung and you've made sure that all the right strings are in the right place,tip,tip,tip,
378.24,379.66,it's turned to the right way,tip,tip,tip,
379.72,383.24,because once you clip this you're never going to be able to use the string again,tip,tip,tip,
383.25,386.3,there won't be enough slack to re put it on if you did something wrong,tip,tip,tip,
386.35,388.76,so at the very end the guitar is in tune,tip,tip,tip,
388.81,390.6,it's polished it's playing great,tip,tip,tip,
390.75,393.3,the very end you're going to flip the strings off,tip,tip,tip,
393.37,399.29,you can just clip it snippet and you're ready to rock it,tip,tip,tip,
