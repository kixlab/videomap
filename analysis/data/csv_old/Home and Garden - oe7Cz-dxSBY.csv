0.47,1.72,welcome to specific love today,opening,opening,opening,greeting,greeting,greeting,,,
1.73,9.06,i'm gonna show you how i built this awesomely simple air filtration system that will do great at removing dust from your workshop or your garage,goal,goal,goal,goal,goal,goal,,,
9.17,14,let's begin now if you ask about any woodworker what is one of the major issues you have in the shop,motivation,motivation,motivation,background info,motivation,motivation,,,
14.01,15.88,that would be dust collection,motivation,motivation,motivation,background info,motivation,motivation,,,
15.93,18.8,dust gets everywhere it's in just in the air,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,,,
18.81,22.4,when you're especially if you're using the table saw or miter saw which is really hard,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,,,
22.41,29.4,even with a good dust collection system it's very hard to even get it to collect even most of the dust,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,,,
29.49,35.84,now i've used a simple four billion that i've tried to have it just a basic filter on to see if that would help,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,,,
35.9,39.07,and it just crap gets stuck all in this filter,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,,,
39.12,41.77,and i don't believe the fan is working at top efficiency,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,motivation,,,
41.82,52.86,so trying to help solve that problem i found this huge four by filter which should give a lot more surface area and a lot more ability for this simple little fan to pull it through,briefing,tool,tool,reflection,tool,tool,,,
52.92,57.77,hopefully in the sense cleaning out a lot more of the air and getting rid of a lot of that dust,briefing,tool,tool specification,motivation,justification,tool,,,
57.82,64.83,now to do that i'm going to build a box around this filter and this fan try and house everything just in one type area,briefing,subgoal,subgoal,goal,subgoal,subgoal,,,
64.88,69.31,so i first started ripping some two by fours down into some one and a half inch strips,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
69.48,72.49,this will allow the frame to be strong and relatively light,justification,justification,justification,justification,effect,effect,,,
72.76,80.29,plus i can keep the wood needed to a minimum and if you look here you should also be able to see all of the dust floating in the air just from cutting a simple board,justification,justification,justification,justification,justification,justification,,,
80.36,82.42,and that is why this filter will be handy,justification,justification,justification,motivation,justification,,,,
82.54,85.95,and then measured the fan and filter and cut the wood into the needed lanks,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
86.58,94.4,a quick test fit showed that the cuts were acceptable and,status,status,status,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
,,since this was just a shop only project i just simply added some screws without concern for beauty,status,status,status,justification,,,,,
94.67,100.4,now it did drill pilot holes for all of the screws to help avoid splitting which can be common in pine lumber,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
100.81,103.5,i then completed the second frame for the other side,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
103.67,107.88,to connect the frames i added two more wood strips to the bottom and two to the top,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
107.95,112.98,these are moved inward about three inches on each side to help avoid hitting the screws holding the frame,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,effect,,,,
113.18,120.2,now when i was using this table so i'll actually had a couple of real dangerous issues happening and i wanted to show you so you can be careful and be aware of this,warning,warning,warning,tip,subgoal,,,,
120.27,130.99,first off when i was trying to rip down one of the two by fours two of the pieces actually tried to bind together and push together and actually squeeze real tightly on the blade and try to kick back on me,warning,warning,warning,tip,description,,,,action
131,139.59,well i tried to keep going and keep forcing it and then of course the amperage pulling from the motor pulled too much and i just lost complete power,warning,warning,warning,effect,description,,,,action
139.6,143.59,i was very fortunate that nothing actually kicked back and came back on me,warning,warning,warning,tip,reflection,,,,
143.6,145.93,so be careful when you're trying to rip me two by fours,warning,warning,warning,tip,tip,tip,,,
146.36,154.19,also when i was trying to rip down a secondary piece i actually had a piece of the two by four break off right in a knot and slide down right,warning,warning,warning,tip,description,,,,action
154.27,155.32,decide to blade,warning,warning,warning,tip,description,,,,action
155.37,162.24,now this could have been catastrophic itself too because it could have easily kicked back or caused some other major damage which could have hurt me,warning,warning,warning,effect,reflection,,,,
162.29,164.64,so be very careful whenever you're using a table,warning,warning,warning,tip,tip,tip,,,
164.65,169.6,saw that real dangerous things can't happen so always be as safe as possible,warning,warning,warning,tip,tip,tip,,,
169.69,174.5,once the frame was secure i grabbed the fans and filter for a test fit and they slid in well,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
175.01,,now to give the structure more strength and keep the fan and filter from falling out,subgoal,motivation,justification,justification,justification,justification,,,
,180.73,it needed a floor and back wall,subgoal,subgoal,subgoal,,,,,,
181.24,184.78,i fortunately had some leftover plywood from the dog house i built in my last,tool,tool,tool,tool,side note,,,,
185.69,191.1,if you have not seen that funny video i will put a link in the description i think,external resource,side note,side note,side note,side note,side note,,self-promotion,
191.11,193.92,cut out the floor and secured in place with a few screws,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
194.91,198.38,at this point i decided to add a ceiling before adding the backboard,instruction,instruction,instruction,description,instruction,,,instruction,
198.67,203.2,besides extra strength this ceiling will add an additional storage area to the top of the fan,justification,effect,effect,justification,effect,,,,
203.41,207.66,so i cut down some more plywood and attach the top and the back with several more screws,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
208.53,213.46,now to keep the fan and filter from falling out of the sides of the frame during transport or getting bumped,justification,justification,justification,justification,justification,justification,,,
213.71,215.7,i added a sidebar on both sides,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
216.29,224.81,these did not have to be super strong but i had some leftover strips and they worked well and then took the frame outside for a quick coating of paint,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,reflection,,,,
225.05,230.05,and then when my wife got home and looked at it she gave me one of those looks you know those looks that,side note,side note,side note,instruction,side note,,,,story
230.06,230.39,well,side note,side note,side note,filler,side note,,,,story
230.4,233.39,she doesn't agree but she doesn't want to tell you you're wrong,side note,side note,side note,side note,side note,side note,,personal anecdote,story
233.64,235.23,yeah one of those,side note,side note,side note,side note,side note,side note,,personal anecdote,story
235.38,239.98,so i asked well what color would you paint it and she said how about brown,side note,side note,side note,side note,side note,side note,,personal anecdote,story
241.6,244.15,ok so i decided to take it out and color it brown,side note,tool,instruction,side note,instruction (optional),,,personal anecdote,
248.17,253.62,now i did discover something that actually pretty cool about first painting this orange and then painting it brown,tip,tip,tip,tip,tip,tip,,,
253.83,260.2,it may be hard to tell in the video but it turned out almost a cherry type color which is really cool hack,tip,tip,tip,tip,tip,tip,,,
260.21,265.09,so if you ever need to make a cherry tight color and all you have and the have is orange and brown,tip,tip,tip,tip,tip,tip,,,
265.27,270.42,do a nice thick layer of orange and then just a light coating of brown and it should come out pretty cool,tip,tip,tip,tip,tip,tip,,,
270.65,275.32,now to help with the filtration i wanted a way to help prevent the large particles from reaching a filter,instruction,justification,justification,justification,justification,justification,,,
275.41,277.19,so i grabbed some old window screen,tool,tool,tool,tool,tool,tool,,,
277.54,284.43,this stuff is easily cut with basic scissors but strong enough to keep small fragments from passing through some measured out the size,tool,tool,tool,tool,justification,,,,
284.5,290.05,waved it around the side support and stapled it to the inside of the frame to keep the exterior looking uniform,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
290.3,295.47,now to keep the fan and filter from falling out of the front of the frame i decided to add a small bungee cord,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
295.92,301.99,so i've tapped in a couple nails in the back sides of the front supports and the cord could be attached or removed easily,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,instruction,,,
302.03,307.39,now that we have this whole setup ready i took the plastic off the filter and we're going to give it the ultimate the best,status,instruction,instruction,outcome,subgoal,,,,
311.78,313.89,ohh yeah that's moving a lot of air,status,outcome,outcome,outcome,reflection,,,,
315.17,315.75,yeah yeah,filler,outcome,outcome,filler,filler,filler,,,
317.32,321.09,now that we know this works we have easy access to change the filters,reflection,reflection,reflection,outcome,outcome,outcome,,,
321.18,324.13,well i don't know exactly where i'm going to put this,reflection,reflection,reflection,outcome,description,,,,colloquial filler
324.2,325.99,that is the big question,reflection,reflection,reflection,outcome,description,,,,colloquial filler
326.22,328.83,so i could easily put this on the floor,reflection,reflection,reflection,outcome,instruction (multiple),,,,
328.88,338.29,i could hang it from the wall and maybe with some french cleats or hang it from the ceiling with some hooks or maybe some hinges so it can hinge back and forth and hang and wherever it like,reflection,reflection,reflection,outcome,instruction (multiple),,,,
338.36,341.47,and you could put this wherever you'd like thanks to the heavy duty frame,reflection,reflection,reflection,outcome,instruction (multiple),,,,
341.54,347.09,and it's pretty lightweight because it is just simple two by fours that i have cut down into one and a half inch strips,reflection,reflection,reflection,outcome,outcome,outcome,,,
347.33,350.44,and so it is really up to you,reflection,reflection,reflection,outcome,side note,,,,comment
