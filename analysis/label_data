Script,Final
"Hey Frances, so I just got back from work a little bit ago",greeting
"My husband, Andrew is still at work, Tristan is at basketball practice and I have to leave pretty soon to bring Aiden to karate",side note
And then I'm going to go work out while he's at karate,side note
so I need to cook something that is delicious and nutritious but that will be easy to make while I'm running around,motivation
The problem is I didn't take any meat out of the freezer.,motivation
"Actually, that is not a problem because today we are making teriyaki chicken in the instant pot and as you may know, cooking something frozen in the instant pot is easy to do, so let's go spice things up",goal
so let's go spice things up,transition
"OK, so the first thing I'm going to do is take my frozen chicken.",instruction
And this is a mixture of chicken thighs and chicken legs and I'm just going to put it right in my instant pot,description
"Next, I'm going to take a bottle of teriyaki sauce and you can use whatever brand you want",tool (multiple)
Just make sure you get a thicker sauce,tool (multiple)
"If not, it'll be too watery.",justification
"And this sauce I like, there's another brand that I also use",side note
This happened to be on sale so I got this one.,side note
And then just put this right over the top.,instruction
"Now I usually like to get some soy sauce and pour it right back into the container, usually about 1/3 cup of soy sauce.",instruction
And then shake it up just to get all the rest of the sauce out of there.,instruction
Support right over the top,instruction
Now we're going to put the lid on.,instruction
"And all you just want to make sure it shuts even if it looks like it comes up past the line, it will be fine because it will kind of melt down, shrink down anyways and then you want to press ceiling.",instruction
And now I'm going to turn manual on and I'm going to cook it for 15 minutes.,instruction
"So the thing about frozen chicken, it takes a lot longer to come up to pressure",justification
"So even though you are cooking it for 15 minutes, it will take a while to come up to pressure, because everything in your pot basically has to heat up and get warm, and then it will come up to pressure and then start counting down from 15 to 0",justification
And then I'm going to let it naturally release for 10 minutes so we'll come back after it's been naturally releasing for 10 minutes,early instruction
And then while my chicken just cooking in the instant pot,late instruction (optional)
I actually like to cook some rice in rice cooker,late instruction (optional)
"Yes, I could cook the rice in the instant pot but for me I like to cook a ton of chicken in the instant pot because we like to have a lot of leftovers for the week, especially some prep meals for me",side note
So this way I can have a lot of rice and I can have a lot of chicken and then of course to go along with the rice,side note
"I like to cook up some either fresh or frozen broccoli, but since I am running around I'm just going to cook some.",late instruction (optional)
Frozen broccoli,late instruction (optional)
Either way,side note
This meal is pretty healthy and I'm excited to eat it,side note
"OK, so it has been naturally releasing for 10 minutes",description
The reason why I want to let it naturally release for 10 minutes is because the chicken was frozen inside and so it has a lot of pressure inside,justification
So when you let it naturally release it kind of like calms it down for a little bit and before you release the valve it doesn't spew out so that's why we are waiting.,effect
"The 10 minutes of naturally releasing along with the 15 minutes of cooked time, ",effect
so we're going to release the valve.,instruction
And now we're going to open it up.,instruction
But we are not done yet.,transition
"So if you can remember, the chicken was frozen sometimes if you're using chicken legs and stuff, sometimes the chickens still frozen together",description
"So at this point I like to kind of turn the chicken over all the chicken that was at the bottom kind of move it to the top, and then the other chicken put at the bottom",tip
And since it was frozen we aren't done cooking it,description
"We want it to be fully cooked off the bone, so before the instant pot I used to make.",side note
This recipe a lot in the crock pot and I would cook it from 9 in the morning to four in the evening and this was with it not being frozen,side note
"Well, we want this chicken to be nice and fall off the bone",justification
so we are going to cook it for another 15 minutes.,early instruction 
"So we're going to put the lid back on, turn it on ceiling again",instruction
So I press the off button and then I'm going to turn on manual and I'm going to cook it for 15 minutes again and let it naturally release for another 10 minutes,instruction
"And the nice thing is, since your pot has already been cooking the chicken in, it's already hot",description
Therefore it won't take nearly as long to build up to pressure.,effect
So we will come back after it has naturally been releasing for 10 minutes.,transition
"All right, time to release the valve",instruction
"All right, we're going to open it up.",instruction
"And if you can see this chicken is has a nice color to it, they are fall off the bone and tender juicy and",outcome
just to let you know the sauce that it has cooked in That is what I put over my rice,tip
"Your chicken is done, but right now I'm headed to karate to take Aidan to karate",side note
And then I am headed to the gym while he's at karate,side note
The nice thing with your instant pot.,reflection
"Keep warm button stays on, so whenever I get home whenever my husband gets home and when my older son gets home from basketball it will stay nice and warm for them",reflection
Whenever they are ready to eat,reflection
"So I'm just going to put the lid back on to keep it warm for everybody, so that's all there is to it.",reflection
Alright guys I am back from the why I had a really good workout,side note
I'm trying to get back in shape in the winter time,side note
I tend to be like a bear and hibernate and Aiden had a lot of fun at karate,side note
"Tristan is back from basketball, he made it on the A-Team so it's pretty exciting",side note
Good job Justin and of course my husband is home from work so of course since I have a household of boys they already dug in and ate theirs,side note
But I'm going to give this a try for you guys.,side note
So I'm going to get a little bit of chicken.,side note
And a little bit of rice.,side note
And some broccoli.,side note
It's a little hot.,side note
Umm?,filler
"It's so good, so much flavor and eating something delicious and nutritious like this doesn't make it so hard to get in shape again.",outcome
Well thank you guys so much,outro
Bye and see you in the next video.,outro
"Alright Aidan, let's head to curb Brady",side note
You gonna say anything?,side note
Yeah.,side note
Excited for caretti yeah be nice and tough,side note
Get strong yeah.,side note
i'm sick,side note
hey guys my name is courtney budzyn,greeting
if you are new here and this is what's for din you haven't noticed,greeting
i'm a little under the weather,side note
it is that time of year when everyone's got the sniffles the coffee magdoff fees,motivation
and the gurgle mix hurdles in their belly,motivation
and when that happens to me the first thing i do is i make a giant pot of soup,motivation
so today i'm gonna be showing you guys how to make a delicious creamy potato broccoli,goal
and cheddar soup that is too die for,goal
it is so creamy it is so delicious,briefing
and it's not overly heavy but it still packs a really good you know punch of flavor,briefing
so without further ado let's get started right,transition
so first things first we are going to chop up our broccoli,instruction
so basically all i do is just glide a knife over the stems of the broccoli and i make sure that i don't cut off too much of the stem because i like to use a little bit of the stem if there is a really thick stem,instruction
how many times are we going to say stem,side note
if there's a thick piece of stem i like to just chop that up and add that to the pot as well,instruction
so what we're going to do is blanch this,subgoal
so i have a pot of boiling hot water and i'm going to add a little bit of salt,instruction
and then we're going to go ahead and add in our broccoli,instruction
now blanching provides an amazing color as well as cooking it really really quickly,justification
so i'm only going to cook this for about three minutes,instruction
i don't want to overcook it,justification
i do not like mushy broccoli soup,justification
i just don't find that to be appealing at all,justification
so after the three minutes i go ahead and take a slotted spoon,instruction
and then i put the broccoli into a bowl full of ice water,instruction
that way it stops the cooking process,effect
and before you drain the liquid out of your pot you want to make sure you reserve a little bit of that broccoli juice,instruction
if that's what you wanna call it because it has flavor in that,justification
it's like a stack of broccoli stack,description
so i went ahead and drained my pot and dried it out,late instruction
and to that i'm going to add a slab of butter over medium the heat to that,instruction
we're going to add some chopped up onion and season that with salt and pepper,instruction
give that a good stir and we want to cook this for about three to four minutes until they start to soften,instruction
next we're going to add some chopped up garlic of course and some seasonings,instruction
i'm using italian seasoning and cayenne pepper my two favorite things in the entire universe,tool
it's really nice to add seasonings at this point because it really helps to bring out the flavor when you add it when you're sauteing,justification
now i only cook that for a minute and then i'm going to dad are thickening agent,instruction
now i'm using flour so we're making a room here,instruction
add your flour and then continue stirring so that you can incorporate all the flour in with the liquid and you wanna keep stirring so that it doesn't burn to the bottom,instruction
cook it for about two minutes to cook out the raw flour taste and then we can start adding our liquids,instruction
so i'm adding my chicken stock and then i have my whisk ready and just going to go ahead and whisk that in,instruction
making sure to get all the clumps out and then i can slowly start adding in my milk,instruction
now you can use cream you can use half and half whatever floats your boat,tool (multiple)
and also don't forget to add your broccoli water so we're going to season once again with salt and pepper,instruction
make sure everything's nice and incorporated and then you can add your chopped up potatoes,instruction
now i just went ahead and cubed my potatoes,late instruction
these are not cooked,description
we're going to cook these in the soup as it brings up to a boil,description
that way you're not overcooking your potatoes because all of your liquids in here are cold and so everything's going to come up to temperature at the same time,justification
so you're not going to have water logged potatoes,justification
now you want to cook your potatoes for about five to six minutes,instruction
we want them to be almost fork tender,description
you want to be able to pierce it but you don't want them to be all the way done,description
if you do cook them too much then it'll just make the soup thicker,justification
it's not really a big deal so once it's to that point i'm going to add a little bit of cream cheese,instruction
yes i know it's a little bit decadent but man is it so good,side note
trust me on this,side note
and of course i'm going to add some cheddar cheese,instruction
now i know it's the orange cheddar,side note
cheese,side note
they didn't have white cheddar at the grocery store for some reason,side note
i don't know what their deal is but it's going to be orange cheddar today,side note
give that all a good stir and that will slowly start to melt together,instruction
now you can go ahead and add your broccoli,instruction
now this step is really dependent on what you like,instruction (optional)
i personally like broccoli soup that has a little bit of crunchiness left to the broccoli,instruction (optional)
i don't like the broccoli to be mushy so you can cook it as long as you want,instruction (optional)
it's totally up to you but i like to cook it for maybe another five to eight minutes and it,instruction (optional)
taste,instruction (optional)
test it,instruction (optional)
if it's where i want it then you're ready to serve and that is it,outcome
you have a delicious creamy cheddar potato and broccoli soup that is perfect for the flu season,outcome
yeah yeah now i'm not going to lie my throat is so sore it feels like there's a thousand people doing rug burn all over my throat and i just want to take the whole pot and just dump it down my throat,side note
so without further ado we're going in for the taste test,transition
wow holy cannoli,side note
pants,side note
i don't know what that means but it tastes real good has a ton of flavor it's not too heavy,outcome
it feels so yeah but on my throat,outcome
like,outcome
i can't even explain how good it feels on my throat,outcome
so with that being said i'm going to shut up now so i can finish my soup and maybe my nose will drain,side note
and i won't sound like a hat a goose anymore because i hate when i'm plugged up,side note
i don't know why it sound like a full on goose,side note
like just want,side note
it's really really not a good look for me,side note

hey what's up you guys,greeting
chef billy parisi,greeting
and we're going to make a delicious detox chicken soup with kale and cannellini beans,goal
in partnership with bob's red mill,side note
i'm going to be using bob's red mill cannellini beans,tool
these are awesome beans,tool
creamy texture slightly nutty loaded with flavor,tool
go ahead and add them to a large container of next,instruction
once they're all poured in go ahead and head over to the sink because we're going to fill it up with cold water about six inches or so over the beans,instruction
so here's a really quick old school trick that i learned way back in the day,tip
you've got those soften up beans and we are good to go,outcome
go ahead and set those beans to the side,instruction
and now i've got some boneless skinless chicken breast,tool
what we're going to do here is season them on all sides with a little bit of sea salt,instruction
next with some cracked black pepper,instruction
be sure to season well,instruction
you know me i cook for four thousand four hundred and twenty three people every time i make soup and ,side note
add in some oil,instruction
next we want to steer these chicken breasts on medium low heat,instruction
we want to get a nice brown on them and cook them all the way through,instruction
so after about eight to ten minutes or so go ahead and flip the chicken over,instruction
so go to your cutting board,instruction
we are going to cut the ends off some onions cut them in half and then small dice them,instruction
the next thing we want to do is peel some carrots and again like the onions,instruction
small dice those as well,instruction
go ahead next and small dice up a few ribs of celery,instruction
and we're gonna finally mince or press about four or five cloves of garlic,instruction
go ahead and add those all together in a bowl,instruction
now we've got some cremini mushrooms,tool
you could absolutely use domestic mushrooms or any other type of mushrooms that you love,tool (multiple)
we just want to sort of cut these into little wedges so go ahead and slice them in half and then slice them again into the little wedges,instruction
and then when the last vegetables we have is a butternut squashincredibly thick,tool
run it down the side again and then,instruction
for these i want a medium dice them,instruction
go ahead and add that to the bowl with all of those vegetables,instruction
go back over to that pot,instruction
we want to remove them set them aside on a plate,instruction
now go ahead and pour in all those amazing vegetables that we sliced up,instruction
we want to cook these for about ten to twelve minutes,instruction
give it a few stirs want to get a very light brown on them,instruction
now at this point we're going to add in our chicken the drained bob's red mill cannellini beans that we soaked overnight,instruction
next we're going to hit it with some chicken stock,instruction
make sure to cover everything and what we want to do is let this cook over low heat for about sixty to ninety minutes,instruction
so head back over to your cutting board,instruction
and i've got two bunches of beautiful fresh kale,tool
i like to thinly slice this up,instruction
but go ahead and thinly slice it,instruction
boom you guys the soup is done,outcome

"Hey, what's up everybody I'm Tommy",greeting
and today I'm going to show you how I made this vice mounted router table with built in dust collection,goal
"Whether it's your first time here or even if you've been here before, welcome to one Minute Workbench.",greeting
"So when I started out building this router table, I actually intended on it just being a temporary jig, but during the building process it sort of evolved into this fully featured router table",briefing
I started off by cutting a piece for the mounting block and a piece for the main surface of the router table.,instruction
I checked to see that the router would have plenty of room and make sure that the device would not interfere with its operation,instruction
Then I secured the two pieces together.,instruction
"Everywhere I used screws, I made sure to drill pilot holes and counter sinks.",instruction
"I chose a bit that was larger than my largest router, bit marked a hole in the center of the table, and then drilled it out on the drill press.",instruction
I lowered the bit into the hole to help me align the router to the approximate center with the router and the approximate center,instruction
I marked the mounting thread locations with a pencil.,instruction
"I picked a forstner bit large enough to accommodate the tool for the bolt heads, and then drill the holes.",instruction
I finished drilling the holes with a 5 sixteenths inch bit to match the size of the mounting bolts.,instruction
"I realized though that the mounting holes on the router were not symmetric, so I had to do it again",description
Starting from the bottom of the table.,description
"I mounted the router in place, set the bit depth for a roundover and gave it a preliminary test.",instruction
"It was all looking good, so I decided to make a fence.",subgoal
"At first I just clamped the fence in place to test it since that was working well, I figured I might as well continue and make it adjustable.",instruction
I just copied the cut out from the fence to the fence base.,instruction
"Now I'm doing these cuts with a bandsaw, but you could easily do these with a jigsaw or a coping saw.",tool (multiple)
"With the fence built, I started working on the adjustment knobs.",subgoal
I rounded all of the corners using my homemade disc Sander.,instruction
"Since I had the Sander out, I took the opportunity to go ahead and round over all the other sharp corners.",instruction
I glued up the knobs and then set those aside to dry.,instruction
"While the knobs were drying, I took some measurements and determined where I wanted the mounting bolts for the adjustable fence.",instruction
"I added mounting bolts, but I'm not going to go into detail on this because as you'll see in just a bit I ended up changing this feature.",instruction
I needed to add slots so I scored a line and then drilled 1/2 inch hole in the center of that line.,instruction
"With a half inch bit installed in the router, I use the hole to install a temporary fence for cutting the slots.",instruction
"Right when I finished making the knobs, I realized I wanted to change things so that the bolts were part of the knobs and not part of the table",subgoal
So I removed the bolts and drilled out large counter bores in the mounting block,instruction
This allowed me to use T nuts and the mounting block.,effect
"To make the new knobs, I drilled 1/2 inch counter bore and A5 sixteenths inch through hole in the main component and then drill to 5/8 inch hole in a smaller bottom component",instruction
This will make sense in just a little bit.,transition
The hole in the knob is intentionally left a little bit smaller than the points of the hex bolt,description
This lets you hammer the bolt in place and lets the wood form a nice snug fit.,effect
"To make sure the bolt didn't back out, I used a nylon lock nut.",instruction
I of course rounded all the corners and then added the bottom components to the knobs.,instruction
I scored a center line on a small scrap and then transferred the center line all the way around the ends.,instruction
Then I used a pencil just to darken the center line.,instruction
I very carefully drilled 1/2 inch hole in the center of that line.,instruction
"I mounted the router in place, inserted the bit into the piece and squared the piece with the outside edge of the table",instruction
Then I made marks to match the center line.,instruction
I carefully transfer the center line to the table itself,instruction
This gave me a mark that is aligned with the center of the bit.,effect
"To test out the mark, I used a very accurate ruler to set the depth of the fence to three inches",instruction
I made a test cut and then measured it with a half inch bit,instruction
The measurement to the inside edge should be 2.75 inches,instruction
"It looked really close, so I measured it with a caliper.",instruction
"As you can see here, it's within 2007 inch which is really close with the success of the first few cuts I decided to build the rulers right into the table.",description
These steel rulers were just a dollar each at harbor freight,tool
I took some basic measurements and cut them down to size using a pair of tin snips.,instruction
Then I use the rulers themselves as a guide for drawing the marks,instruction
I would need to embed them in the table.,instruction
I carefully aligned a scrap of wood and clamped it in place so it could work as a guide for my router.,instruction
I set the router's bit so that it would cut a slot just a little bit deeper than the thickness of the ruler.,instruction
I then repeated the process for the other side.,instruction
I added hot glue to the slot and set the ruler in place,instruction
Unfortunately I was moving kind of slow here and the glue actually set-up before I could get the ruler pressed all the way down,description
So I used a heat gun to soften the glue so I could push the ruler down until it was flush with the table.,tip
"I thought it would be quicker on the second one, but I wasn't and wound up having to use the heat gun again.",tip
The heat gun did the trick and the rulers were perfectly flush with the table top.,outcome
I removed the excess glue from the rulers with a little bit of Windex.,instruction
I added the router back in place and used the alignment block to make sure the router was perfectly centered with the line.,instruction
My first Test cut was at 2 inches and with a half inch bit,outcome
"When measured to the first edge should be 1.75 inches and as you can see here, the result was within 5 thousandths of an inch, which is very good.",outcome
"With the accuracy on point, I turned my attention to creating dust collection dust collection around the router itself is the trickiest part, so I started with that for this first cut",subgoal
I was able to trace the outline of the router and cut it out on the bandsaw with a little bit of back and forth,instruction
I was able to get a nice fit.,description
"I then worked on the upright walls of the box, which I just had to eyeball and make some test cuts on again",instruction
With a little bit of back and forth,description
It was done in just a few minutes.,description
"The rest of the box was just small square pieces, so I cut those out and started assembling it.",instruction
I traced out the top of the box and trimmed it to match the rest of the pieces.,instruction
I changed my mind about the side I wanted the vacuum on,description
So I plugged the original vacuum hole.,instructional (optional)
I cut a few small blocks that would allow a threaded knob to hold the box in place.,instruction
I then added a tee nut that would accept the threaded knob.,instruction
I marked the threaded rod with a Sharpie so I could see where to trim it and then trimmed it with a hacksaw.,instruction
"And for safety, I filed the sharp edges until they were smooth.",instruction
I added some foam to the edges of the box where it contoured to the shape of the router.,instruction
I then added a small wooden block and used some hot glue to attach a foam block that would cover the last remaining opening.,instruction
These small guide blocks will just make it easier to properly align the box.,justification
The bottom dust collection box allows the router to be lowered and raised while the box is in place.,description
"With the bottom dust collection box and the vacuum line in place, I made a test cut",outcome
"It didn't collect all the dust, but I would say it got about 75%.",outcome
The threaded knob allows me to quickly remove and replace the box when I need to change router bits.,outcome
The top dust collection box was a lot easier than the bottom one,description
"I just glued it, clamped it in place and let it dry for about an hour.",instruction
This top dust collection box is perfect for round overs and pretty much collects 100% of the dust.,description
"With everything working good, I took it all apart and prepped it for finishing for finishing",instruction
I applied 6 coats of satin water based polyurethane and sanded in between coats.,instruction
I'm really happy with how the router table turned out,outcome
"As I mentioned before, it was just going to be a temporary jig, but I'm happy that I took the time to go ahead and build some more features into it.",reflection
"Hey, thanks for watching",outro
"I really hope you liked this video if you haven't already, be sure to like and subscribe and make sure you hit the bell icon so you get notified every time there's a new episode",outro
"I'd love to hear what you think of this vice mounted router table in the comments section below, and if you have any quick questions you want answered, hit me up on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter",outro

hello,greeting
do it yourselfers,greeting
i'm terry peterman the internet electrician,greeting
welcome to another one of my video shorts on current topics,greeting
let's get started all right,transition
in this short video we're going to troubleshoot a desk lamp here,goal
when we arrived at our place here in costa rica this lamp worked just fine,motivation
so what went wrong,motivation
well first of course the most obvious thing is to check is the light bulb and and i changed the bulb and still no functiona on this one,late instruction
so let's try and swap it with one that we absolutely know works,instruction
is you never know when you get a bad bulb,jusitification
so we'll switch the one out of the bad lamp,instruction
put it in the one we know it works and it does it,instruction
and and the one we know was working,instruction
still nothing,outcome
so we're plugged into the same outlet,description
i guess you can always try that because sometimes and this is actually a good tip,description
lots of times in homes you're going to find that half of the outlets are switched and half as hot all the time,tip
half is on a wall switch,tip
so just to make sure that's not the case here which i know it isn't,tip
but what you want to do is swap them then you're sure,tip
so we've swapped the lamps and that one still works and not outlet,outcome
and this one doesn't,outcome
so what we've got to do is take this lamp apart find out what went wrong,subgoal
so one thing you want to do is examine the socket inside of the the lamp here,instruction
now you can see this point right in there that makes contact with the center of the bulb,description
that's your heart and this is your neutral that touches the shell of the light bulb itself,description
one thing i notice here i don't see any burnt points like lots of times,description
you'll find that rivet down here on the on,description
the center pin is corroded so that can cause you problems,description
that's one thing to check,instruction
the center pin should also have some spring to it not be all soft and malleable but this is good,description
it's spring steel and here make sure that there's no corrosion on what makes contact with the shell of the bulb for the neutral,instruction
all that seems good in this one but i did notice the socket is loose,description
so if you look right down in here there's a phillips and a standard blade screw head machine screw head that's loose,description
so we're just gonna tighten that up a little and that makes the socket nice and tight in there,instruction
we'll bend it back to the center position so that's not the problem,instruction
we're going to take the base off this lamp and see if something went wrong with the switch,subgoal
so again with the lamp unplugged,description
as you can see there's three screw holes here that just hold this plastic base on,description
remove those i've got them all loosened up,instruction
take the base off and have a look and right away i see what the problem is,instruction
i let me bring you in for a close up of this,transition
so here's the rocker switch that turns this lamp on and off,description
you'll notice on the other one it's an inline lamp cord switch that operates it,description
but this one's got a a switch on the base,description
well as soon as i pulled that base off you can see what the problem is,description
this is just a simple single pole switch single pole rocker switch and this brown wire was popped right off of a terminal of the switch,description
soul,filler
the neutral is carried right on through to the lamp socket and it's fine but we got to resolder that wire on to that,early instruction
there you go to that little terminal right there,early instruction
and once we do that i'm sure this lamp will work,effect
so i just need to add a little bit of solder to these connections,instruction
so i've got my iron nice and hot here,tool
now you'll see,transition
i'm just going to touch the solder to the tip make sure that it's hot enough to melt,instruction
solder and it is,instruction
so there's probably some residual solder left on the terminal but i'll add a little bit anyway,description
so what you want to do is touch your iron down to the wire and the terminal and they need to to both get hot enough to,instruction
you'll see the sodder flow into the terminal when things are hard enough and i'll touch up to the other terminal as well,instruction
too much there,description
you don't want too much solder just enough to i just enough to flow into the wire and the terminal,tip
there i saw it,outcome
i saw it flow into the terminal,outcome
i think that's about as close as i can get that shot blow on it cool it off a little bit,instruction
and i see that switch is a little bit loose in there but i have a good solder job between the wire and the terminal,outcome
so now that i've got my soldering complete you can see it's all nice and tight on that terminal,outcome
and that one's good,outcome
now before i put the base on i'm just going to test the lamp and make sure it works,subgoal
and then we'll put it all back together,subgoal
so i haven't put the bass back on yet just in case there's still something wrong,jusitification
but let's test our lamp out and it works as it should be and the other one's working so we can put that bass back on,outcome
and we've saved ourselves a few bucks,outcome
it's not an expensive lamp but in this day and age of throwaway society you can see just how simple it can be to repair something like this instead of tossing it out,reflection

welcome to specific love today,greeting
i'm gonna show you how i built this awesomely simple air filtration system that will do great at removing dust from your workshop or your garage,goal
let's begin now if you ask about any woodworker what is one of the major issues you have in the shop,motivation
that would be dust collection,motivation
dust gets everywhere it's in just in the air,motivation
when you're especially if you're using the table saw or miter saw which is really hard,motivation
even with a good dust collection system it's very hard to even get it to collect even most of the dust,motivation
now i've used a simple four billion that i've tried to have it just a basic filter on to see if that would help,motivation
and it just crap gets stuck all in this filter,motivation
and i don't believe the fan is working at top efficiency,motivation
so trying to help solve that problem i found this huge four by filter which should give a lot more surface area and a lot more ability for this simple little fan to pull it through,tool
hopefully in the sense cleaning out a lot more of the air and getting rid of a lot of that dust,tool
now to do that i'm going to build a box around this filter and this fan try and house everything just in one type area,subgoal
so i first started ripping some two by fours down into some one and a half inch strips,instruction
this will allow the frame to be strong and relatively light,effect
plus i can keep the wood needed to a minimum and if you look here you should also be able to see all of the dust floating in the air just from cutting a simple board,justification
,description
and then measured the fan and filter and cut the wood into the needed lanks,instruction
a quick test fit showed that the cuts were acceptable and,instruction
now it did drill pilot holes for all of the screws to help avoid splitting which can be common in pine lumber,instruction
i then completed the second frame for the other side,instruction
to connect the frames i added two more wood strips to the bottom and two to the top,instruction
so be careful when you're trying to rip me two by fours,tip
so be very careful whenever you're using a table,tip
saw that real dangerous things can't happen so always be as safe as possible,tip
once the frame was secure i grabbed the fans and filter for a test fit and they slid in well,instruction
now to give the structure more strength and keep the fan and filter from falling out it needed a floor and back wall,justification
if you have not seen that funny video i will put a link in the description i think,side note
cut out the floor and secured in place with a few screws,instruction
so i cut down some more plywood and attach the top and the back with several more screws,instruction
now to keep the fan and filter from falling out of the sides of the frame during transport or getting bumped,justification
i added a sidebar on both sides,instruction
she doesn't agree but she doesn't want to tell you you're wrong,side note
yeah one of those,side note
so i asked well what color would you paint it and she said how about brown,side note
now i did discover something that actually pretty cool about first painting this orange and then painting it brown,tip
it may be hard to tell in the video but it turned out almost a cherry type color which is really cool hack,tip
so if you ever need to make a cherry tight color and all you have and the have is orange and brown,tip
do a nice thick layer of orange and then just a light coating of brown and it should come out pretty cool,tip
now to help with the filtration i wanted a way to help prevent the large particles from reaching a filter,justification
so i grabbed some old window screen,tool
waved it around the side support and stapled it to the inside of the frame to keep the exterior looking uniform,instruction
now to keep the fan and filter from falling out of the front of the frame i decided to add a small bungee cord,instruction
so i've tapped in a couple nails in the back sides of the front supports and the cord could be attached or removed easily,instruction
yeah yeah,filler
now that we know this works we have easy access to change the filters,outcome
and it's pretty lightweight because it is just simple two by fours that i have cut down into one and a half inch strips,outcome
so if you have a great idea of where to put this where the hang this or where ever you think i should do it,outro

"Hi, I'm Ashley Weston",greeting
I'm A Celebrity menswear stylist so you may or may not have seen my recent video about my top four sneakers that you should own now,greeting
"If you haven't only get in the video description below, but if you own sneakers, you will inevitably have to clean them",background info
"So today's video is about how to clean your sneakers and this will cover your leather, canvas and woven sneakers",goal
"But first, let's get into the tools that you're going to need now",transition
"You may not use all of these tools, it's just going to be dependent on what.",transition
"Exactly, you're cleaning on your sneaker, but I'll definitely be sure to mention what tool is specifically needed for certain sections on your shoe",transition
"So first up, you're gonna definitely need a bowl of water",tool
It doesn't matter what temperature it is next,tool
You're going to need your brushes,tool
"So I've got this magic Racer sponge, which is really great to clean your midsole now if your midsole has any kind of texture to it, you may actually need a toothbrush to really get in there and lift off that dirt",tool (multiple)
"Next, you're going to need a standard synthetic shoe brush like I've got.",tool
"Here by Jason Mark, this is going to clean the upper of your sneaker",tool
"But if you are working with premium Leathers or woven materials, you actually want to go with a boar bristle brush which will be a lot softer",tool (multiple)
"So I'll definitely link all of my favorite products to use when cleaning your shoes in my article, which I'll link below for the cleaning solution, you can either go with an eco friendly all natural dish soap you just put a little bit in some water",tool
Make sure though the most important thing is that it should say on the bottle that it it is fragrance free.,tool
Dye free and non-toxic,tool
"This is going to ensure that it doesn't cause any yellowing on your shoes, so I personally like using Jason Marks cleaning solution",justification
I just find it to be more effective than the dish soap and the,tool
last thing that you need is going to be a microfiber towel,tool
This is just to wipe down your shoe at the very end,tool
That's it,filler
So now let's get into how exactly you should clean your sneakers,transition
"So first, if it's just the midsoles of your sneakers that need to be clean, then all you need is just a magic.",instruction
"Eraser dip the sponge in a bowl of water, squeeze to remove any excess water, and then you're going to just rub the sponge on the midsole to remove all of that dirt",instruction
"As you can see, it's really working.",description
"There is this part in the back where the dirt is just not lifting off, and it's because I have a textured midsole",description
"So in order to really lift the dirt out, I'm going to just use a toothbrush and take my Jason Markk solution and just put it on the toothbrush, shake it out, and then I'm going to start scrubbing to really get that dirt out of there",instruction
"It's going to lather up like very nicely, which you want",description
You just kind of vigorously scrub.,instruction
"OK, so I scrubbed it pretty thoroughly all around and now I'm just going to take my microfiber towel and just wipe my midsole and look at that",instruction
It is so much wider it really lifted that dirt off,outcome
"If your sneaker needs a deeper clean, then we got to go a little bit further than that, so let's get into how to completely clean the entire sneaker",subgoal
"First off, what you want to do is take your microfiber towel and just wipe the surface of your sneaker",instruction
This is going to remove.,effect
Any kind of loose dirt that is sitting on the top of the fabric,effect
Now what you want to do is if your shoelaces need to be cleaned,subgoal
"If they seem really dirty and your tongue is really dirty, you just want to unlace your shoe and then throw the laces into the washer with a load of whites on the hot cycle you want hot water to wash your laces, and that's going to get them nice and clean",early instruction
"So let's get started by getting your brush ready, dip it in some water, shake off the excess",instruction
Then you're going to take your Jason Markk solution.,instruction
And pretty much douse the brush,instruction
Be really generous with the amount of liquid you put on and then dip the brush back in and just shake off the excess,instruction
And now we're ready to completely scrub the shoe,subgoal
"I always like to put my hand inside the shoe just to be able to hold it,",tip
and then I'm really just going to scrub the shoe,instruction
"You want a nice lather like this? See, my tongue is very dirty.",description
"So as I'm rushing the upper, I'm also still just going to scrub the midsole, get the entire area of the sneaker.",instruction
"So sometimes you have hard to reach areas like this piece in the tongue, so I'll use this toothbrush to really get in there and just scrub it",instruction
Same over on this side,instruction
"So now what we want to do is wipe it completely down so we'll take our microfiber towel and I'm just going to wipe away all of that foam to see if there's any areas that still need to be brushed and just a quick note, if you are dealing with a woman upper like these fly knits, then after you scrubbed the upper what you want to do is take a microfiber.",instruction
Towel and just dab and twist so that it will remove any excess moisture on the woven upper,instruction
And then you'll let it air dry,instruction
But you don't want to wipe it down,instruction
because that can potentially cause fraying and nappiness to your woven material,justification
So I've wiped these down,outcome
"I'm going to just inspect the entire sneaker to make sure that there are no dirt spots that I still want to scrub out, but I am very happy with this",outcome
I love how this turned out,side note
"Next, we're going to let them air dry and then once they're dry, I'm going to lace them back up with my clean laces. ",early instruction
So these are fresh out of the washer,outcome
There's so much wider than The Dirty ones that we started off with,outcome
"Alright, so this is how your sneakers should look after you spend about 5-10 minutes cleaning them",outcome
They look now pretty much brand new and really fresh and great,outcome
Do this about every one to two weeks depending on how dirty your sneakers get and that'll ensure your sneakers looking brand new every single time,tip

I'll have everything that I use today.,outro

hi youtube,greeting
welcome to my channel,greeting
so today's video i'm going to show you guys how i achieved this really cool voluminous ponytail using the bellamy bugatti,goal
said just simply that volumizing west,goal
so it's like one really thick track and i did this in under five minutes,briefing
and it really looks really cool nice and put together in my opinion,briefing
so i really hope you guys like it,side note
and if you guys don't know how to do this and of course this video is going to help you guys out,briefing
if you guys do try this i'll definitely let me know in the comments below,outro
and if you're new to my channel please subscribe and join this mini family,outro
so without rambling on further let's get into the video,transition
ok so the first thing we're going to do is just put our hair in a high ponytail and do it at the level that you want the ponytail to be,instruction
of course i would highly recommend using a brush,tip
my brush is like dirty right now but just to clean up and make you polish,tip
unless you guys want it to look more messy that's completely up to you,tip
but usually when i go out i like to polish it so i'm just brushing that up put it in a high high ponytail,instruction
and then that's it,side note
no i'm joking,side note
ok hold on,side note
so now that we have our ponytail and we are satisfied with how that looks,outcome
so we're going to move on to the fun part,transition
oh crap on the floor,side note
not a good start,side note
take care of your extensions and don't listen to me there,side note
ok so you guys can see,side note
oh my,side note
god,side note
it comes with so much hair,side note
it's beautiful,side note
so you guys can choose to do this before after,instruction (multiple)
but in order for it to blend because these are quite wavy i would also like to curl or wave the ponytail,instruction (multiple)
i think i'm going to wait until after i click these in,description
so basically we are going to take this and put it over,instruction
so we're just going to clip that one by one just right above that elastic,instruction
i just try to stay as tight as you can towards that elastic,instruction
so once you wrap that around you click it so make sure it's well wrapped around the whole,instruction
the lastic,instruction
you know once we have that,transition
we're going to take a piece of the hair from the extension and and really cover that track up,instruction
you want to just adjust everything,instruction
make sure it looks good,instruction
umm this looks pretty good to me i from what i see ,outcome
and i'm going to take a bobby pin or several in an ex form,instruction
i would recommend so that the body can really stay in place you guys can't really see,justification
but holy moly,filler
ok s,filler
o this is the extension right now,outcome
but yeah,filler
so basically that is how it looks like just after literally three minutes of just dropping the extension in,outcome
of course it's not perfect,outcome
you're going to see parts of my hair that don't necessarily blend as much only because it's not curled,outcome
and the extensions are,outcome
i'm using an iron one one inch curling iron forty dollars and,tool
and curl it like the extensions,instruction
just by a kind of opening up the barrel and turning it like this,instruction
we had about seven seconds,late instruction
let it drop,instruction
now what i would normally do is maybe just clip this curl let it sit's when it's hot so that it the curl stays a lot longer,tip
but i'm just going to hold it for a few seconds while it cools and that might help,tip
so we repeat this process till you are satisfied,instruction
i'm really excited that i finally have the guts to make this youtube channel and share with you guys the the tips and tricks that i like to do every single day,side note
because honestly i was doing this for fun,side note
regardless i'm like i might as well film it like what am i doing,side note
so so i really hope you guys enjoy this as much as i do and i'm definitely looking forward to expanding my channel and getting to know more of you guys,outro
especially when i'm done school so i can really focus on making a really fun content for you guys and being very consistent,outro
so hope you guys enjoyed this,outro
umm it was really easy and quick and yeah i definitely recommend you guys trying it out,outro
if you guys don't have a volumizing set like this you can definitely do the same process using a few rows of extensions,tip
so yeah let me know if you guys do try this out,outro
and until next time i'll see you all in my next video,outro
bye i,outro
"Hey guys, it's Sandy",greeting
Welcome back to cute Polish,greeting
In today's video we're going to be talking about dip powder,goal
"Nails dip powder has been all the rage this year, but the application of it can sometimes get tricky",motivation
so Julie will be sharing her tips and tricks today on how to perfect your dip powder manicure at home,goal
"Hey, it's Julie now let's get started with the video",transition
"First things first, you're going to need a dip powder kit",tool
"There are a lot of options right now, but for this video I'll be using the Kira sky.",tool (multiple)
"Kid, because it comes with everything you need and it's packaged and easy steps one through 5 bottles ",justification
as you would with any manicure you're going to want to start with cleaned groomed nails,instruction
This means push your cuticles back,instruction
File your nails into shape and remove any residue from the nail plate.,instruction
"This particular kit comes with step by step instructions for how to use the dip powder, which I do follow, but I have learned a couple things that weren't mentioned in the instructions, which I will share with you a little later",tool
The first step is to apply a thin layer of bonder,instruction
"This is basically just a dehydrator and it's going to remove the excess oils from your nails to make sure the dip powder adheres properly, but don't panic",effect
This is supposed to leave your nails looking pale and really dried out,effect
Step 2 is to apply the base.,subgoal
"Polish to 3/4 of your nail, then quickly dip it into the natural colored dip powder",instruction
This is going to help disguise any visible nail line you have and make the final color more opaque and even,effect
"It doesn't say this in the instructions, but you have to work one nail at a time because the base dries fairly quickly and you need to get that powder on while it's still wet, or else it will not stick at all",tip
Another thing I don't think the instructions clearly state is to dip your finger in at about a 45 degree angle until it's completely submerged in the powder and then pull it out.,tip
Tap off the excess powder and let it dry while you move on to the next nails,instruction
"Tapping your finger will remove the majority of the loose powder, but there might be quite a bit still stuck to your nail",effect
"So what I like to do is, once the base and first layer of powder are dry, maybe about two or three minutes, I'll take a big kabuki brush and dust off the excess",tip
This will keep the layers thin and keep product from building up on your brushes,effect
Now you can grab the colored dip powder,instruction
"I'll be using this deep red shade that's funnily named hot chocolate, and just like before.",tool
"Apply the base, but this time you can apply it to your entire nail and then dip it into the colored powder",instruction
"Word of caution, these powders are extremely pigmented, so you're going to get some color on your skin, but it will wash off later with soap.",tip
"If you see any spots you might have accidentally missed, it's OK to add a little more of the base than dip it again",instruction (optional)
Here's where I ran into problems when I first did this,reflection
"If you applied the base over top of your first coat of color and there's still loose pattern on the nail, it will gunk up on the brush and the nail and look super lumpy",reflection
"So that's why I like to let it dry, then dust off the excess and apply a second coat of base.",tip
And dip again,tip
"Don't worry if you have some bald spots like I do here, that's due to the base drying before it comes into contact with the powder and 2nd coat will totally cover it up.",description
On my accent nails I decided to use a gorgeous silvery glitter powder called sterling ,tool
"and I followed the same steps as before, doing 2 coats of color.",instruction
"After I have all of my color powder on, I'll next be dipping into clear powder to add a barrier to the color",early instruction
"so when it's time to file, I don't accidentally file off the color.",justification
"Then after that I'll be moving on to Step 3, which is seal and protect and applying a generous layer of that to each nail",subgoal
"One of the biggest benefits to dip powder is that it dries incredibly fast, so you don't have to worry about accidentally smudging anything",background info
Now you can go ahead and file and buff the nails,instruction
"I used two different files, starting with a coarser 1 to remove the bulk.",instruction
"Then I switched to a finer grit file to smooth out the surface, and when you're done filling, you can go ahead and wash your hands with warm soapy water and dry them thoroughly",instruction
"Now we're going to add one more layer of the seal and protect, but before it dries, wipe it off with a lint free wipe",instruction
This is just going to remove any excess debris that might still be on the nail and get the nail ready for top coat.,jusitifcation
Step FOUR is to apply a layer of the top coat in quick short strokes and try not to over manipulate it,instruction
"The instructions for this kit say to let that dry, then go in with a second coat at the top, which I did do, ",instruction
"but I wasn't super happy with the shine, so once that completely dried I did just pop on a layer of plain clear top coat to make it extra glossy",instruction (optional)
Finish with the nourishing oil to rehydrate your skin and that's it,instruction
"Unlike a gel manicure, dip powder dries hard as a rock so your nails won't have any flexibility and will stay super strong.",background info
"And when it's time to remove, follow the surface of the dip manicure to break the seal, then wrap it as you would to remove a gel manicure with an acetone soaked cotton ball",instruction
I actually made a huge mistake here and didn't file the dip powder nearly enough so the acetone didn't soak deep enough into the layers,reflection
"And when I went to remove it, I made the incredibly amateur mistake of peeling it off and I actually tore a piece of my nail",reflection
"Fortunately, it was just a corner and it was on my thumb so I was able to file.",description
Found the damaged area but please please please don't peel it off,tip
File down the powder as much as you can and soak it for at least 30 minutes,late instruction
"And if you have an e-file that will probably work even better, it won't quite dissolve like gel wood, but it will become soft enough that it pulls off easily when you remove the cotton ball and foil",tip
"If you guys have any tips you'd like to share, go ahead and leave them in the comments below, and if you'd like to watch more helpful cute Polish videos, you can click on these boxes here and you can click on the circle to subscribe to cute Polish.",outro

this is doctor gregor in the kitchen where i take the science and put it into practice,greeting
today,goal
i know that sounds kind of gross but bear with me,side note
it starts with five it reusable bags and a stock of celery goes into each,instruction
what do you do with the half you have leftover,side note
dip it in some hamas of course,side note
hmm,filler
hmm,filler
then saving the best for last the healthiest food on the planet,tool
greens,tool
so you know even though something like arugula has even more nitrates in fact i think the most nitrate packed food there is and i think is even tastier,justification
there's no way it would last five days,justification
starts to turn yellow gets slimy so it would have been using is really hardy greens like kale and curly parsley,justification
plus kale has something spinach doesn't have its cruciferous,justification
so i'm gonna put a cup of each one in each bag,instruction
and then all the bags go into the fridge and wait their turn,instruction
and then when you're ready to rock and roll here's what you do,transition
if anyone tries that let me know how it how it comes out,side note
and then finally the juice from half of a lemon,tool
it fits into about one perfect ok mason jar,outcome
yep look at that,outcome
then you pop in a a the reusable straw and and a cold refreshing zesty,outcome
who's zesty,outcome
umm and uh,filler
and to think what's in this thing right,outcome

"Today, for the very first DIY series from Robert and Archery, ",greeting
we're gonna be making one of these.,goal
"That is, a builders bucket target.",goal
So let's get started,transition
"First of all, we need to get in one of these.",side note
And then we need to go to one of these.,side note
Now we need to buy one of these.,tool
Michael.,filler
"So we've got our builders bucket, what we're going to need next.",transition
Is some of this?,tool
"Actually, quite a lot of this.",tool
So we've got our main constituents of our bucket target,tool
We've got the bucket and we've got the filling,tool
Believe it or not.,side note
That's the majority of what we need,side note
We're so far,side note
I think I've spent about 6:00 or €7.00 on this,tool
"You're talking five or six dollars £5 in the UK, something like that",tool
So without further ado that needs to go in here.,early instruction
Right there we go,side note
"As you can see, it takes a lot of packing",outcome
"Now the heavier the bow, the tighter it needs packing",background info
"I'm packing this for anything up to 6070 pound bows, so it's well packed in there",description
Let me show you what I'm replacing the cover on.,transition
Now this one here.,reflection
Is I'm not sure whether.,reflection
It's at least two years old,reflection
It could be as much as four years old.,reflection
And I've recovered recovered it,reflection
Ohh at least three or four times,reflection
And now you can use whatever you like to cover it,tool (multiple)
I've used Hessian is the easiest,tool (multiple)
That's burlap in other places around the world,tool (multiple)
Or utisak if you're in Germany,tool (multiple)
"I've used what else have I used? I've used felt backed carpet, which works really surprisingly well.",tool (multiple)
One of my favourites is this stuff.,tool (multiple)
The big bags that you get about a ton of gravel in.,tool (multiple)
You get companies who just.,tool (multiple)
Throw that away,tool (multiple)
They don't want him anymore because they might be ripped away,tool (multiple)
They just cut out the bits you want,instruction
"Hey Presto, you've got to cover a cover for your target.",outcome
So basically all you need to do now is cover it,subgoal
Put some tape around to hold the cover in and you've got a workable target now.,subgoal
"To show you guys what I mean just for today I'm going to use Hessian and I'm going to do the new one, so let's have a go at that first.",tool
"Right there we go, there's one Hessian sack opened up to its full width now then.",instruction
"The best way to compress that while we're putting this on is to have it upside down now, as you can imagine, as soon as you turn that upside down, it could conceivably all come out",early instruction
"It's pretty obvious, so here's a little tip and I've tried both with and without some plain old kitchen cling film",tip
"You can actually wrap more or less the whole bucket in this stuff, and you could actually shoot it like that",tip
I've used this stuff before,description
This is like the stuff they used for.,tool
"It's the industrial stuff they use for wrapping pallets that works pretty good too, but if you're careful you can actually turn it on top of whatever cover you're using and tape it that way",tool
"That's what we're going to do today, and I'll zoom the camera in so you can see what I'm doing.",transition
"Right, what I'm going to do is just cover this with the Hessian first of all.",instruction
Keep it reasonably tight and then just.,instruction
Tip it upside down like this.,instruction
And then just poke everything in.,instruction
As much as I can Around the edges,instruction
and you can see how this could be.,description
Just a little bit tricky.,description
Now the tape I'm going to use today is just plain packaging tape.,tool
I'm not sure how this is gonna work,side note
"I usually usually use duct tape or something similar, but let's see how it goes.",side note
Right?,side note
And there we go.,outcome
Up basically.,outcome
Is our finished target.,outcome
You can actually shoot on that.,description
So there we go,outcome
Not only have we got.,outcome
"A very robust target which will last for a long, long time",outcome
"Yeah, you'd need to replace the face from time to time,",reflection
but don't you on all targets.,side note
But check this out.,transition
It's that easy to withdraw the arrows now.,outcome
Hessian couple of little tips for you with Hessian,tip
"It can rot if it stays wet for too long, so this is probably the least robust option",tip
"The next favorite for me would be felt backed carpet that tends to last a fair while slightly harder to withdraw the arrows, but still pretty good",tip
And my favorite is the big bag.,tip
Cover I've got one somewhere,side note
Just hold on there.,transition
"So yeah, this is an old.",description
Big bag cover that I've just split to take off,description
You can see how it's shot out in the middle,description
That one was probably I don't know,description
"A year old, maybe longer and you can see they're more robust tape",description
I've used on my own so that's just to show you guys,description
I'm probably going to take this back off and get some decent tape,side note
What else can I tell you about these things?,side note
Some of the instructionals use clothes cloth.,background info
Kind of wool.,background info
Industrial wall type stuff and there's nothing wrong with that,background info
It stops arrows brilliantly,background info
They even use it for crossbows,background info
I'm pretty sure this would stop a crossbow too.,background info
"I tried it on two or three targets, and.",reflection
I'll tell you the problem.,reflection
Number one it gets wet.,reflection
"Number two, when it gets wet, it gets very heavy #3 when it gets wet and heavy it starts to stink",reflection
There you go moldy and getting rid of the clothes,reflection
For me at least here in Germany was a pain in the backside,reflection
"OK with the plastic, it's waterproof",reflection
"It stays light, you can leave it out all year round",reflection
"It's not an issue, so my advice would be use the plastic, put some kind of robust cover on it, like the big bag or tarpaulin material even.",tip
Experiment with it and you've got a target there which.,tip
"Yes, is worth.",tip
I don't know a hell of a lot more than the five or €6.00 that I paid for this.,tip
"Be careful of rolling, yes, they've got handles on sometimes",tip
I choke it,tip
It depends what ground you're on,tip
"If it's flat, not a worry and the plastic for these stuff, they're not a rubber",tool
"This is plastic, but it's a very",tool
It's a very elastic plastic,tool
"Again, let me show you one that's been used.",transition
"OK, now I don't know if you can make out on this.",side note
You can see here.,transition
If I can catch the light you can see here where I have had arrows penetrate where they've gone along the side of the packing,description
"OK, so make sure the packing is as tight into the side of the bucket as you can, but you can see it doesn't split",late instruction 
It doesn't shatter the plastic,description
You can actually kind of just peel that off so.,description
That's the kind of material you're looking for,description
"Now if you take that technique and here's a bonus for you, it's very easy.",tip
"To take a uto sack, Hessian sack, burlap sack, whatever you want to call it and do exactly the same thing",tip
Now this one is one that has been.,description
Shot out there we go,description
You can see how I've kind of tacked it together with cable size or zip ties,description
Whatever you want to call them,side note
And the center was shot out.,description
So all I've done is put another slack over the top.,description
And it's ready to go,outcome
So there we go guys,outcome
That's bucket target and Hessian target all in one all right if you can find the right bucket,outcome

hey fellows me,greeting
trepper here today,greeting
i'm going to give you a quick tutorial on how i build a beaver snare from beginning to end,goal
i buy all of my snare supplies from southern snares dot com and i would urge you to do the same,tool
so give brian mckee a call,side note
southern snares dot com,side note
tell him what you want or if you don't know what you want just call them and tell them what you want to catch and he'll take care of you,side note
so let's get started,transition
the first thing that we have is our snare cable,tool
this is a four foot piece of one sixteenth inch cable one by nineteen twist and as you can see,tool
it has been dipped in formula one's giving a giving it a slight brown color,tool
so we have our snare cable,tool
as far as tools we need cable cutters to cut our piece of cable we're going to need a good solid hammer to hammer our parts on,tool
and we'll need a pair of good american made needle nose pliers,tool
as far as parts we're going to use double ferrals and this is one sixteenth inch double ferrals,tool
we're going to need our snare lock and you can see these locks,tool
i'm using slim locks today and these have also been dipped in formula one,tool
we have our vinyl tubing snare supports cut to,tool
i don't know half an inch or something like that,tool
we have our swivels and today i'm using a nine gauge heavy duty swivels,tool
we need our swivel washers which are just little washers like this,tool
and we have stop buttons,tool
and i'm using the three thirty second inch stop buttons,tool
and i'll explain why,tool
when we get to the portion where we put that on,tool
so let's get started,transition
step number one is to take one end of our cable and we're going to take a double ferrell,instruction
we're going to slide it on the end of the cable and what we want to do is,instruction
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to use my needle nose pliers to bend that over and then i'm going to hold it with the pliers and then insert it,instruction
ok so now we're going to hammer this shut,instruction
so when you try it you'll see but start with your i see if i can get that palm up and then i see that's a natural roll over on that table,instruction
and then i'm going to,instruction
i put a little memory in it and work and work at once or twice and ,instruction
what you want to end up with it is something that looks kind of like that,outcome
now the next thing is to load the cable,subgoal
i use just a nail on the side of this and like i say for details on how to load cable,description
watch my other video on it,background info
i'll put a a link to it up on the screen,background info
but i'm simply going to hold that and then you're looking for a little bit,instruction
ok so now we have our terminal end double federal loan,outcome
we've got our cable loaded,outcome
the next step is to thread the snare lock on it,subgoal
today i'm using slim locks,tool
now,tool
every lock will thread a little bit differently especially if you're using cam locks,tool
but what you want to do is you want to go back to the free end of the cable,instruction
and on this slim lock you want to put the free end of the cable through the hole the non locking hole and let me see if i can,instruction
i'm going to pull this all the way through so that,instruction
now i have this to the tab is facing the terminal end,outcome
i go back to my free end and then put it through,instruction
i like this,instruction
pull it through and you can see there is our snare,outcome
and now the next step is to put our vinyl tubing support collar on it,subgoal
and this is probably i don't know,tool
half an inch of vinyl tubing,tool
the exact diameter of the tubing is based on what diameter cable that you're using and also what diameter support wire that you're using,tool
but you're just going to slide that on the free end all the way down so that when you go to to set the snare,instruction
the next step is to put your swivel on and you just stick to the free end of the cable,instruction
i like this,instruction
slide that on down,instruction
normally i would have a smaller diameter washer with a smaller diameter hole and i would use a one sixteenth inch top button,tool
but i'm not the smartest guy,side note
now the way that works is is you can see see that cable is free to rotate inside the swivel,outcome
that's what allows it to swivel it,outcome
so at that point our snare is finished and,outcome
as you can see it's pretty simple,reflection
you know the the the thing is is when you're doing it yourself if you screw some cable up,tip
or if you don't have something exactly like you want it you can toss it out or or whatever,tip
cut it up and save the parts and redo it but you're in control of it not somebody else,tip

Greetings and welcome to a very Quick ,greeting
guide on distributor replacement for Chevy V8 Vortec engines,goal
If you need more explanation I have a full length video version of this one that should provide all the information that you need,background info
The only thing I'd recommend that I don't cover in this video is making a mark on the distributor body as well as one on the intake manifold in order to reference it later when installing the new distributor without this mark they could potentially set a check engine light code P1345.,tip
In which you would need a scan tool in order to set the Cam crank correlation,tip
Otherwise everything else should be covered in this video,briefing
"If you need more information, like I said, check out my other video.",background info
"Once the distributor CAP is removed, you will want to rotate the engine over the top dead center number one compression stroke",early instruction 
"To do this, you'll want to remove the fan shroud, then manually turn the engine over until the timing mark on the balancer meets the timing mark on the timing cover with the timing marks lined up",early instruction 
If the distributor rotor is pointing at #1 spark plug wire then you know you have the engine in the correct position,early instruction 
If the rotor is pointing at #6 spark plug wire then you need to rotate the engine over and.,early instruction 
At that point you can go ahead and lift the distributor straight out of the engine.,instruction
"OK, looking at the new distributor, we'll notice a few marks that we want to get lined up before we install the distributor",instruction
"First off, we have this dimple here at the bottom of the distributor",instruction
What you want to do is line that dimple up with the white painted line there.,instruction
"These marks tell us where to set the distributor before we install it, so this is the starting position of the distributor",description
When you go to install it into the engine.,description
"I took the liberty of making these two marks right here, so the purpose of these marks, this one is where our final position is",late instruction
This is where our starting position is so.,description
Looking back here.,description
That's our final position,description
"If the rotor button were installed, we'd be pointing right here our starting position as we know.",description
Is with the that dimple and that line.,description
Lined up,description
so you can make a mark like that if you want,late instruction (optional)
"If you want to install the distributor with this rotor button already on, you can do that by making this mark",late instruction (optional)
This will tell you where this needs to face and when it's completely installed.,justification
It should point there.,justification
"OK, so we got all the marks lined up as we talked about and we're going to install the distributor",subgoal
Make sure that that flat spot.,instruction
On the distributor is roughly parallel.,instruction
With the back of the intake manifold.,instruction
"OK, we've got the distributor where we want it, so just going to put this clamp.",instruction
On the body of the distributor.,instruction
And then finger tighten this bolt.,instruction
So you can see a few bumps with the starter,description
It it didn't quite want to drop down so I just wiggled the base and it dropped right down into the oil pump drive so no need to use the screwdriver to line anything up,instruction (optional)
That's going to waste a lot of time,instruction (optional)
It's much easier just to just to get this.,instruction (optional)
"Just get that hold down right there, start it onto the base of the distributor, get the bolt run down just enough to hold it snug",late instruction
"Don't tighten it, just finger tight so that this clamp is snug to the distributor base and then bump the starter",late instruction
"Normally it'll just fall right down by itself, but but for some reason it didn't that time",description
So I just wiggled the base right here and it dropped right down.,late instruction
So we'll just barely tighten this bolt.,instruction
May need to make some adjustments later.,reflection
"OK guys, we're going to wrap this up",transition
One piece of advice I will give you is if your installed distributor does not look almost identical to this then don't start the truck because you'll have to reset the top dead center on #1 cylinder and you're probably going to get a check engine light,instruction (optional)
It really needs to be installed almost identical to what I have here,instruction (optional)
The rotor should point at the small triangle with the number 8 or towards.,instruction (optional)
"That number one spark plug wire? What have you? If it's not pointing here and it's pointing back towards the firewall at #6 spark plug, then it's not going to start and needs to point towards number one",instruction (optional)
"If it's not exactly on number one, that's OK, but it has to be very very close",instruction (optional)
"If it looks like it's more than a couple degrees off, then you're going to have to start over from scratch or at least pull the distributor out and see if you're off",instruction (optional)
"Maybe a tooth or two, but if you line up all the marks like I showed you.",instruction (optional)
"You shouldn't have any problems getting it right on at least the first or second time, so after that, go ahead and get your distributor cap back on your wires",instruction
"Back in, place airbox back in place as well as the fan shroud and you should be good to go",instruction
"If it has the check engine light P 1345, then and you're sure your distributor is installed correctly, then you may just be off slightly and at which point",early instruction
"If you can't get it manually adjusted, you may need to.",early instruction
Have someone with a scan tool to set that for you,early instruction
Thanks again and good luck.,outro
today had a clean and maintain your vehicle's leather interior for the summer and spring or all year round for that matter,goal
and my jeep grand cherokee has been kind enough to volunteer today to do this,tool
i have partnered with lexol to test their products in order to renew and protect my leather interior,tool
this vehicle is about three four years old and we definitely have some wear and tear on it and also some stains that i'm hoping that it will get out,motivation
lexi's been around since nineteen thirty three,background info
in addition to working on the leather interior of your vehicles you can use their products on boots luggage sports equipment,background info
shoes furniture and handbags et cetera to be,background info
i'll be doing a two step process in this demonstration,briefing
first i'll use the leather deep cleaner which will pull some of the dirt and oils off the seat,briefing
hopefully get some of this wear and tear off the edge,briefing
also you can see a little dark mark right here which might be from the seat belt rubbing over time,briefing
plus i have some sticky spots for maybe some soda spilling,briefing
then i'll be using the leather deep conditioner to finish it all off,briefing
so here's what we're dealing with,description
in the back seat of my jeep grand cherokee,description
looks like soda splatter,description
something sticky and dirty all through the back seat,description
i'll give you before and after,description
definitely not clean,description
two concerns of mine,description
this one right here,description
of course because of the seat belt rubbing against there,description
that's bad,description
it's kind of dull all over and this spot here where everyone sits steps into the car whether they have dirty jeans or whatever it is,description
but you can really tell,description
hope you can tell,description
i know i can from my view that it's dark right here from just the rubbing of people getting inside the car,description
so that is our before and we'll come back in a matter of minutes and this will be gone,subgoal
and this will be gone,subgoal
just watch,transition
you'll find directions on the back of the bottle,background info
but i'll tell you right now shake it really well,instruction
you'll need a couple of rags,tool
i got a damp one here and this clean one,tool
this is dry or use this to wipe up afterwards,tool
so after a shake it i'm going to spray on here a couple of sprays,instruction
there's a damp part it's gonna come out kind of clear,description
so we're going to do is going to rub it in,instruction
i will be here i'm go directly on see if that makes a difference,instruction
yeah a little more suds there,description
lex all does offer an applicator sponge or brush that if you want to get a little deeper in it for some of those harder to clean out spots,tool (optional)
so i've already used this,description
it says you can use a a damp cloth to wipe it down which i'll do now,instruction
it's going to wipe off any of the excess here and then i'll show you the after,instruction
only downside about doing a video like this and putting on youtube is that all my friends and family are going to ask me to clean the leather inside their vehicles after they see how good this works,side note
ok i'm done with step one,transition
the cleaning is complete,transition
let's do a little before and after video because i think you'll be really impressed,transition
all right the moment of truth,transition
here's the armrest in the middle,outcome
no more stickiness nice and clean don't you think,outcome
one thing i can't convey on camera is how good this smells like a new car smell,outcome
no it's better,outcome
here's a spot where people get in trying to show you a nice and close up how to clear that looks how new it looks,outcome
now let's go to that spot by the seat belt,outcome
can you see the mark,outcome
maybe a little bit,outcome
i still have the conditioner to apply,subgoal
step two begins like step one,transition
shake the conditioner,instruction
we'll squirt a couple of squirts on our towel or your applicator and we'll apply it to the seat and then let it sit for a couple minutes,early instruction
then we'll wipe it off,early instruction
all right,filler
i'll let this sit for a couple of minutes and i'll come back with a clean cloth and i'll wipe off the excess,early instruction
ok i'm back after a couple of minutes,transition
so let's go ahead and wipe this off and then we'll do a final look at how we've done,instruction
here is your final look,outcome
we showed you the before,outcome
we showed you after the deep cleaner and this is after the deep conditioner,outcome
i'll let your eyes tell you the truth of how good this looks,outcome
the thing is it also smells great,outcome
how about that edge on the spot that i was most concerned about right there,outcome
can you see it,outcome
barely,outcome
a well i think the results speak for themselves,reflection
the combination of the deep cleaner and deep conditioner did an amazing job on the interior of my jeep grand cherokee,reflection
it looks brand spanking new smells great and looks great,reflection
go to lexol dot com for more information and to find the closest place to pick up your lexol products,side note
until next time,outro
thanks so much for watching,outro
i'll see you next time,outro

hello ladies and gentlemen ,greeting
today i'm working on a two thousand and twelve and a sonata,goal
the issue we're having here is that the break lights do not work consistently,motivation
the third eye brake light and this one here has always worked but these side lights are not working consistently,motivation
so they have removed some of the bulbs in them in order to keep them from burning out,briefing
and i believe there's a short and we're going to try to find it,briefing
but first i'll show you that the lights are working,subgoal
so we have all the lights working and and you can see that the running lights are actually working here,instruction
i'm gonna go ahead and shut those off,instruction
nice to see that they're off baby,instruction
we hit the brakes so if you can see that just the third eye is lighting up,instruction
so i'm going to diagnose and test some of this wiring and i will let you know what i find,subgoal
they put bulbs in and they burn out very quickly,outcome
and just recently i noticed my neighbor was driving around and brake lights haven't been working so i figured i would offer to help them out,motivation
ok so you can see that all three brake lights are currently working on,description
the issue was that they kept burning out,description
what i have done to correct this problem was instead of using the factory twenty three fifty seven light bulbs,outcome
i went with the eleven fifty seven which burned at least thirty percent cooler than those twenty three fifty sevens,tool
the alternative will be to go with led lights if these happen to burnout or get too hot,tool
if you install led lights you will need a load equalizer with each light,tool
most kits come with two load equalizers and two led bulbs,tool
it'll run you about fifty dollars,tool
so what i did here to fix my problem was it was actually quite simple,subgoal
but it was just it took a while to find i was,subgoal
i came in to to the trunk,instruction
here you remove these felt pads,instruction
i'll remove the ball but i'm not going to touch anything while there's power running to it,instruction
but you can see there bulb is on,description
i'll go ahead and shut that off,instruction
you can see there that the socket it has been pretty hot,description
that's the only reason it'd be discolored that way,description
oh i took a the tools such as this with the power off,tool
so you you can take that tool and you see all those little tabs in there,description
see all,description
mine is slightly sticking out well,description
those were recessed in almost like maybe it wasn't getting complete contact maybe it was getting too hot and eventually in,description
the metal was just pressed in there,description
i've read that some people are having these bulbs actually cook in there melting into the socket,description
if that is the case you can purchase these at your local hardware store or parts store and you just have to cut into these three wires and splice in a new the harness like this here,instruction (optional)
so that's a pretty straightforward deal,side note
this here is now and eleven fifty seven,outcome
instead of a twenty three fifty seven,outcome
it is much cooler,outcome
i can actually take it out right after it's been on for a little bit rather than the twenty three fifty seven,outcome
i couldn't even touch it and it actually smelt like something was burning over here,outcome
but these prongs,description
they get hot enough,description
on those twenty three fifty sevens,description
i've seen that they are melting in there completely just melting everything,description
it's definitely a fire hazard and it definitely needs to be addressed by a hyundai,description
but until they do so or until they have a recall i am going to kick it down to eleven fifty sevens,reflection
and hopefully this will fix the issue,reflection
i've tested some stuff,tip
under the dash,tip
there's a stop signal relay under there,tip
it does not click if you test that,tip
it's about a ninety dollar relay so i wouldn't just purchase it throw out the car and hopefully fix your issue,tip
because chances are it won't work,tip
so replacing these uh knees out harness is here and putting brand new bulbs in there,tip
i mean brand new,tip
go,tip
buy them open the package put them in,tip
don't just install something you have laying around,tip
make sure that you know exactly what you're installing so you know how to judge the the lifespan of the ball,tip
and i,reflection
i think this will work just fine but if it does not i will install those led lights and then i'll make a video on that,reflection
so hopefully this has helped,outro
thank you so much for watching and stay tuned for future videos,outro
so i have these eleven fifty sevens installed,outcome
you can see them during the day,outcome
all of the prongs were readjusted to make sure there were good contacts,outcome
something else i recommend doing,tip
you'll see that when you purchase lights inside the store,tip
they have some grease that they recommend putting on so your sockets involves,tip
don't get stuck together over time or corroded so it's just dielectric grease,tip
you could take a tiny bit of this,tip
squeeze them out here so just a tiny bit,tip
i don't think you could accident put too much on here but then just apply it right on the end,tip
here,tip
you could even reply it on the outside,tip
just rub it on there and that will keep it from corroding,tip
reinstall it and i will keep you safe for quite some time,outcome
in order to replace these bulbs,subgoal
what you'll need to do is you pop your trunk,instruction
you pull these little felt pads out of here,instruction
the carpeted pads move,effect
those make sure that you do not have power to your lights that we currently do not have power,instruction
so you will come over here to your this one,description
here on the far outside is the tail light and the brake light,description
you turn it,instruction
blurry move,instruction
and then install your eleven fifty seven,instruction
instead of this,instruction
twenty three fifty seven re insert it,instruction
these two need to be on the side,instruction
small one needs to be straight up and then just spin it clockwise to tighten it in there and there you have,instruction
so hopefully that has been helpful,outro
please feel free to like and subscribe and and let me know if this helps you out,outro
thank you very much for watching,outro

I'm going to show you a really easy way to take off the keys from a desktop keyboard and then clean the inside of them and pop the keys back on,goal
"So on keyboards like this, it doesn't matter if they're wireless or wired because they're normally attached to a desktop",background info
"They're really easy to do and normally it's just a one piece key so laptops can be more complicated because normally there are three piece keys, so it's got the key retaining key, and then another little bit inside that with this one.",background info
"Yeah, normally these are just one piece, so it's really straightforward to do so",background info
"Let's say for example, if we had a problem with a bunch of keys, you might have spilt something on it",description
Or you might just have a problem with one key before going out and getting a new keyboard,description
"Just try doing this to start with, just try blowing it and tapping it just to see if you can get the dirt or the dust out of it, or dislodge and just try hitting it numerous times and that might just free it up",instruction
Give it a blow.,instruction
See if it makes a difference,instruction
"If that still doesn't work, then we need to leave the key out, so this isn't hard to do",instruction
All you need to get is a blunt knife or a Flathead screwdriver,tool (multiple)
And let's say now if we had a problem with.,description
A bunch of keys here or just the J,description
Then I'm just going to leave it out,description
Now,transition
"If you've got a bunch of keys and you need to leave it out, a lot of them take a picture of it",early instruction (multiple)
"So get your phone and take a picture of the keyboard, because there's a chance that you might forget what key goes where",early instruction (multiple)
Either that or just write the keys down,early instruction (multiple)
and it will save you a headache when you've put them back together having to take them out and trying to swap them again,justification
"So basically, let's say if we did have a problem with this J here, all I need to do is get the knife underneath it and then just leave it out and just.",instruction
Pop it out,instruction
"What I would say is when you're doing this, just make sure it's disconnected",instruction
So this is just a a wireless keyboard,description
So just make sure it's in the off position,instruction (multiple)
"If you've got a wired keyboard, just unplug the USB cable from your PC when you're doing it",instruction (multiple)
Now you can see how easy that came off,outcome
It just popped off and then what you do is you get some,outcome
This is the UK so this is called surgical spirit,tool
"If you're from America, it will probably be called rubbing alcohol",tool
Good stuff about this is it cleans it and then it just evaporates off after a couple of minutes so you don't have to douse it in it,tool
just put a little bit of surgical spirits in the lid and get your Q-tip.,instruction
And justice.,instruction
Put it in a bit of surgical spirit and then what you need to do is just clean inside,instruction
"So clean all around in here and hopefully that will get rid of any stickiness or grime or dirt that's gone in there and also give it a little clean inside as well, because inside here is where the actual key moves up and down so it could be sticky in there as well, so give that a clean and then you get your key.",instruction
"And again, this shaft here just give it a clean.",instruction
Around the edge there.,instruction
And then let it air dry for a minute or two just to get rid of to help the surgical spirit or the rubbing alcohol just evaporates off now just to show you it working on this USB keyboard,instruction
"This is a wireless one, but this one's a wired one",description
Exactly the same principle as well,description
"These keys are slightly more inset into the keyboard, so, but it's still very easy to get them out",description
So let's say now if we had a fault on the.,description
"G over here again, we just get our screwdriver in",instruction
"It doesn't matter, we can do it from the top, the sides",instruction
The bottom doesn't make a difference,instruction
Let's go in the side and nice and gently just leave it out and again you can see it's just a one piece design so you can see that it's just held into place.,instruction
Buy 2 little retaining clips here and here so it's a very simple design,description
And again with this one here you would just get your Q-tip and give it a good clean all around all the places you can reach,instruction
If you find that in this instance here it's a little bit tight to get.,description
The Q-tip in those bits there you could just use a screwdriver and just clean around the edges there you can also.,instruction
Get a bit of kitchen roll or tissue paper or something and just use your screwdriver.,instruction
In the tissue paper like so and then give it a good clean.,instruction
Around the edge there and that should get off any dirt that's in it,effect
"Now to replace it nice and straightforward, make sure you've got it the correct way up",instruction
Pop it in there like so and you just push it back in until it clicks into place and that's it,instruction
You can see now that the movement is nice and free.,outcome
"Alright, so on this one here",transition
Hopefully it's all evaporated off by now,description
"I can still just see a slight residue just down the bottom there,",description
So what you can do is you can just get a dry q-tip and just.,instruction
Get rid of the last little bit soft rubbing alcohol.,instruction
And then you get your key and you just lay it on there and justice push it back in again like so and it pops back in again,instruction
So really straightforward to those,side note
"So if you having problems with your keyboard, just take a few minutes out to clean the keys and then hopefully you'll get a bit more use out of it",side note
"Well, I hope you like the video",outro

what up nerds machina hair,greeting
and today i'm going to make an iron throne phone charger,goal
with the second season of demo thrones right around the corner i really wanted to make something related to it so i ended up with this,motivation
i'm gonna use this usb cable,tool
i know it's purple but it's what i had and i'll fix that up later and this fits my android phone,tool
i'll also use two packs of these plastic cocktail swords and some other materials i'll get to soon,tool
i began preparing the cocktail swords by cutting off this part of the handle so this is the difference,instruction
now i just gotta deal with the rest of them,transition
at first i bought a pack of three hundred swords which turned out to be way too little so i had to buy another pack,tool
and i actually ended up using all the six hundred swords,tool
all right i'll put those aside,transition
for now,transition
i continue to make a basic shape of the throne out of some scrap mdf i had lying around,instruction
i marked up the size of my phone first and then drew a back piece that would be a bit wider than that,instruction
then i marked the seat with the same width and the death i wanted,instruction
finally i cut out all the pieces with a bandsaw on the back of the seat and the sides of the throne,instruction
here are all the pieces i used both with glue and tiny nails to attach the pieces together,instruction
the back piece didn't meet the sides so it was a bit wobbly but i fixed that by gluing some angled brackets to the inside with some strong epoxy glue,instruction
now this is what i have and what it should look like,outcome
to create the actual shape of the throne,subgoal
i'll use some thick foam that i can cut into smaller pieces that looked somewhat like the shape i wanted and then use hot glue to attach it,instruction
it looks kind of rough at this point,outcome
but i gradually built up on that with more foam on top,early instruction
i'll add a layer of thin grey foam which will even out all the surfaces,instruction
i did it only at the back first because i have to adjust the placement of the cable which i'll show you in a second,justification
i'm beginning in the long process of gluing on swords on the back first because this will determine the distance from the back to where the phone charger should be placed,instruction
when the back was done my lines my phone up against it and drew a line at the front,instruction
i measured the right distance and drilled the hole through from underneath for the cable,instruction
i had to fix it up a bit with the file to get the right shape and now it goes through,instruction
also drilling a path at the back so the cable can lie smoothly against the table,instruction
as i had the position of the phone on the charger i could build up with foam around it,instruction
covering that up with a thin gray foam too,instruction
before i continued i made sure to cover up all the other surfaces as well in several places,instruction
on the throne it looks like the swords are bent and twisted around some edges so i used my heat gun to warm up the plastic and bend it to the shape i needed,instruction
and then i could just glue it on where it fits,instruction
i just checked how the phone fits before i started adding swords to the seat and it fits nicely,instruction
while gluing on the swords i left the picture up that i could use as a reference while working just to make it easier for myself,tip
also if you're wondering well i am color coding the sections it simply because i found it easier to actually see the depth and the layers of the swords,tip
where to fill in and in which direction the swords were pointed,tip
it would have looked more chaotic with all the colors in one place,tip
well at least to me,side note
for the top crown of the throne i only needed the blades of the swords,description
i kept the handles as i need those lighter,instruction
time to glue the blades around the edge,subgoal
by the way we're giving away the headphones that i've made recently so if you want to participate,side note
make sure to check the link below,side note
i was getting really close to the end and i just had to cover the last two sections on the back side,outcome
now i could use those extra handles along the edge at the top and along the three ridges on the back,instruction
all right nice,filler
all the swords have been glued on,outcome
looks like a very fabulous and not so iron throne,outcome
also the swords in the corner are all thus left of those six hundred,description
and i used them to cover any holes that i thought were too large,instruction
before painting i had to spend some time removing blue threads from in between the swords,instruction
when it looked nice and clean it was ready for the next step,transition
i used the regular spray paint for indoor and outdoor projects that could be used on plastic,tool
i coated the whole thing black first as this will bring out the right shades i need for the iron effect,instruction
it needed a couple of codes from different angles to get into all the nooks and crannies,instruction
it already looks a lot better in black for the next layer,outcome
i'm going to use this acrylic silver paint to make their own,tool
looked like it was made out of iron,justification
i tried the technique called dry brushing which basically means that your painting with close to no paint on the brush and justice lightly highlighting the correct parts of your object,background info
there's a lot of nice and detailed tutorials on dry brushing on youtube already so check that out if you're interested,background info
i just slowly built up the iron color with several layers to not make it too bright in the wrong places,instruction
i still wanted to keep a lot of the black as it creates the right shading effect just for comparison,justification
here the right side is painted with the first layer of silver paint while the left is just a black base,outcome
i probably could have left it with just the silver coats but i decided to use some bronze acrylic paint to create some extra depth,instruction
i was very careful not used in much of this,description
i added a few spots here and there,instruction
because too much would ruin the whole iron look,justification
finally i could attach the cable to get it into the right position,instruction
i connected it to my phone and pushed it in place,instruction
i chose to use hot glue because despite that it might not be the strongest or most durable glue it wouldn't pour,tool 
found the sides of the charger and glue that to the phone,tool 
i let it dry plugged it in and it works,outcome
but i still wasn't a fan of that purple cable,justification
so i decided to use the leftover spray to make it black,instruction
when that's dry it's actually done,outcome
it was a time consuming project but i definitely think it was worth it and it looks really badass on my desktop,reflection
i hope you enjoy this build,outro

"Hello, creative people and welcome back to my channel today",greeting
It's finally the day where I will show you how to individual customization of basic pattern for buddies,goal
So I'm going to show you today how you can make your basic pattern buddies in your own custom size,goal
So before you start watching this tutorial you have to go and watch my video of how to create a basic pattern in size 38 for the Buddhist and I will put the link in my description box below.,background info
This video so you can find it faster or you can just find it on my channel as well,background info
"Once you watch that video and you have the basic pattern in size 38, you're going to go back and click on this video and ",background info
I will show you how you can adjust it into your own size.,goal
"OK, now that you have the basic pattern for Buddhist inside study eight, it's finally time to make some changes so it will fit your body",goal
In this video I will go out from my own measurements so I will change the basic pattern size 38 into my own size and these are the same changes you have to do if you are smaller or if you are bigger,briefing
Just follow my steps and you will succeed.,briefing
"Change as little as possible, and only if you can consider it reasonable.",briefing
"Before we start to make any changes on the pattern, we need to take a body measurements",subgoal
Here are the body measurements that you will be needing to create your custom pattern,instruction
If you don't know how to take body measurements,background info
I already did a video on my channel so feel free to watch that as well.,background info
The first measurements are from the neck to the waist and that is for me,instruction
"It's 40 centimeters, so it means that this pattern was actually 41, so I have to take away minus 1 centimeter",instruction
And if I'm taking away or adding you can see the arrows,instruction
That is where you have to add or take away,instruction
"In my case, because my back is a little bit smaller, about 1 centimeter, I need to take away minus 1 centimeter and I'm just folding my paper about 5 millimeters",instruction
So together it's 1 centimeter.,instruction
It's always good to take your measuring band and just to measure if the measurements are correct.,tip
"If your back is bigger, you need to cut, open and add extra more in there",early instruction
Depending on your measurements,early instruction
"For example, if it's 42 you need to add 1 more centimeter extra.",early instruction
"Moving on to the bus sign for the bus line, you're going to measure your bus for me",early instruction
My breasts are 92 centimeters and I divide that in half so it's 46 centimeters,early instruction
Then I'm going to go ahead and add 4 centimeters extra,early instruction
This is very important to add 4 centimeters extra because of the movement,early instruction
Then you're going to divide that in half and it's 25.,early instruction
"So this means that my breasts are bigger than size 38, which means I have to add 1 centimeter extra",early instruction
So I'm adding one centimeter extra on the side of the Buddhist,instruction
"I'm making a straight line from this point to the waistline, and ",description
"it's very important that you know that if you are making any changes on the bus line, it does affect underneath the armpit",tip
So you might have to add a few millimeters,tip
I will show you shortly in the video what I mean.,transition
"If your breasts are smaller, then you need to maybe take away minus 1 centimeters",early instruction
"This is exactly the same thing that I just showed you, but you're not going outwards",early instruction
Instead you're going inwards.,early instruction
Moving along to the waistline,transition
My waistline is 72 centimeters and you have to add 4 centimeters extra because of the movement and once again you have to divide that with four,early instruction
And in my case here I don't have to do any changes at all because it fits perfectly,early instruction
If you have your waistline is bigger you have to increase on both sides and the incisions,early instruction
Baseline is small,early instruction
Then you have to take away from the front piece only in the incisions.,early instruction
And on the back piece it's better to create one more extra incision so you will have two incisions on the back.,early instruction
For the shoulders I'm gonna start to create a helpline that is just a straight line from the outer points of the shoulders,early instruction
"For me, my shoulders are about 15 centimeters and it means that I have to actually add one more extra centimeter because of the movement",early instruction
So I'm just going to go ahead and add that.,early instruction
The last change is your bust length,subgoal
"If your busts are a little bit upwards, or if your ***** are a little bit downwards, these are the adjustments that you have to do",early instruction
"I don't usually like to play with this part just because it's not necessary for me, but if you want to, you can do it",early instruction (optional)
And this is what you have to do.,transition
Adjustment is made on the frontline of the inner part of the Buddhist incision,early instruction
Pacelines incisions length always has to be adjusted as much as the bust incision,early instruction
Easier said,early instruction
"If your ***** a little bit down, you have to move the incision",early instruction
"Both incisions, a little bit downwards",early instruction
"If your ***** are a little bit up, you have to move the incision upwards, both of them.",early instruction
"For the sleeves, my arm length is 57, so it means I have to take away 3 centimeters and I'm taking them away right where the arrow shows.",early instruction
"If your arm length is longer, then you have to add right where the error shows",early instruction
Add exactly the same amount of the extra measurements that you need to add to the pattern.,early instruction
"Then you're going to measure around your arm, and for me it was 27 and you have to add at least 5 centimeters or 7.5 centimeters, and ",early instruction
in this case I didn't have to change anything because it was perfect,description
"But if you have to add or you have to take away, these are the photos that you can follow how to do and ",instruction (optional)
this is how I make my basic pattern for Buddhist in my own size,outro
"If there is any part in this video where you did not understand, please.",outro
Comment below and I'm going to try my best to answer each and every comment,outro
"I really hope you get the same results and even better, and you can finally have your basic pattern for buddies in your own size so you can create and follow my duis",outro
"I really hope you like this video and if you did, please give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to my channel",outro
Like always,outro
If you have any other suggestions or what kind of videos you want to see on my channel please comment below,outro
See you till next time.,outro
hi everyone suzanne here i hope you're all well and welcome to you custom,greeting
today's video is going to be a patterning video,goal
so there's no sewing or anything in this video which just how to make a standard princess seam bodice from your standard bodice block,briefing
so if you're interested in seeing that then or let's get started,transition
so starting with my bodice blocks on the right is my front,description
on the left is my back,description
on the front i have two darts one towards the waist and one towards the shoulder and on my back,description
same again just a small dart at the shoulder this time and a larger dart at the waist,description
i'm using this book to help me out in the patterning,background info
it's called pattern cutting made easy and it's by gillian holman and it is a fantastic,background info
and now on to the tracing,subgoal
so i'm just tracing out here both my blocks,instruction
i'm making sure when i'm tracing that i'm adding all of the markings from the blocks to my pattern paper,instruction
which by the way is just standard parcel paper,tool
i'm using here,tool
so i'm marking the dart legs at the end i'm marking the apex point and i'm marking my notch at my arm hole,instruction
so on the back of marking the legs of the shoulder dart finishing the neckline and marking the apex,instruction
marking the point of the dart at the shoulder and then just to draw in those darts again,instruction
shoulder dart we start and i'm just drawing a dashed line between those darts and that will help me out later on,instruction
when i come to cut out the princess seam on the back so you'll see that a little bit later,justification
marking back in my darts,instruction
in the front we stand shoulder and that's the tracing complete,outcome
so now on to the front,subgoal
so i've just marked in my arm hole notch there so that you guys can see a little better,instruction
and to draw in my princess seam line i'm just going to draw it in by hand so it's a nice soft curve that starts at the apex and finishes at the notch of the armhole,instruction
curve is curving slightly up towards the shoulder seam,description
i'm popping in balance marks so straight across the curve,instruction
i've just drawn and straight across the entire dart and this will help me out later on when i come to soul,instruction
because these will become notches and once i line those up correctly it will mean that my seam is all matching as it should be,justification
so just cutting away the side front from the front so we're cutting along that curve making sure i'm maintaining that curve when i'm cutting and cutting down the right hand side dart leg,instruction
so that's my y side front separated from my front,outcome
and now i want to remove the dart on the waist suggest cutting up the left hand side dart leg,instruction
and removing completely,instruction
this is no longer required in the prince's scene so that's gone on,description
and now to remove the shoulder dart,subgoal
same thing here,instruction
this is no longer required so to remove it i'm just going to cut down the left hand side dart leg,instruction
right down to the apex and through the apex separate that piece totally and then join up the dart legs,instruction
and i want to make sure that my shoulder seam is nicely joined up but the apex point is located where it should be,instruction
and that the dart legs are lined up right along that cut edge,instruction
so once i'm happy that that's all in place i'm sticking everything down,instruction
and now i,description
i just have a couple of jagged edges both on the side front and on the front and both at the apex point,description
so i want to soften up those edges,subgoal
so on the side front i'm just drawing with my french curve as a soft line so i want to remove that excess paper away from there so that i have a really lovely soft curve,instruction
and the piece that i'll remove's needs to be compensated on the other side and also to remove the jagged piece on the other side,instruction
so i'm just doing exactly the same thing here again but this time i'm adding paper,instruction
so just drawing in a nice soft curve there sticking everything down,instruction
once i'm happy that everything's in place as it should be,instruction
and now removing the excess from the side front and you'll see here the excess i cut off slots in nicely to the piece that i added,instruction
so cutting off the excess on the front piece,instruction
and that is the patterning done for the armhole princess scene,outcome
so i just have a couple more things to do here and that is to label so the side front and the front,instruction
and then just to add a one centimeter seam allowance all around so labelling is now complete,instruction
mine seam allowance has been added so i have one centimetre the entire way around both pattern pieces,description
so that's my front bodice complete,outcome
so that's a princess seam ending at the armhole for the back,description
i thought i would show a slightly different princess scene so this is a princess seam ending at the shoulder,description
so starting with adding the balance marks in exactly the same way as i did on the front,instruction
so i'm cutting up the right hand side dart leg directly through the dashed line i drew earlier,instruction
and through the right hand side dart leg at the shoulder separating the back from the side back,instruction
and the only other thing left to do for this type of princess seam bodice is to cut away both of the darts,instruction
so first of all the waist just cutting directly up the left hand side dart leg and the same for the shoulder cutting directly up the left left hand side dark leg,instruction
so we're moving both of those darts so these as in the front are no longer required,description
just labelling,description
adding it in my one centimeter seam alliance,instruction
the hallway around and that's how easy the back is so you could do the same way on the front,outcome
and i just wanted to show you two different ways,outcome
so that's my one centimetre seam allowance the whole way round,outcome
and both pattern pieces are now complete,outcome
and this is how the back looks so you can see the seams running the entire way up and the front of the seams ending at the armhole,outcome
this is a brilliant bodice for fitting so you can fit right the entire way along those seams,outcome
so add any skirt you like to this and you'll have a beautiful dress,outcome
so i really hope you guys enjoyed the video,outro
i hope you find it useful if you did give it a thumbs up,outro
if you've not yet subscribed please do and i shall see you in my next one,outro
until then i hope you have a fantastic few days,outro

You don't have to have low back pain to have burning or pain or discomfort or weakness into your lower extremities,background info
I want to show you my 4.,goal
Favorite stretches four favorite stretches to help combat sciatica,goal
Realize that most sciatica does not come just from the disk,background info
"Even though you may have a herniated disk, a bulging disk or disc degeneration from improper positioning and posture quite common.",background info
With a nerve makes its way out of the lower back going into the buttocks around the piriformis muscle,background info
"When that area becomes contracted and shortened, it can inflamed that lower buttocks area, affecting that sciatic nerve root",background info
"So I'm going to show you 4 safe, great stretches you should be doing for lower back sciatic type pain and hopefully will take you out of this major distress",goal
The first one is the piriformis stretch I've showed this many times.,subgoal
"In many of my videos, but it is so important that you don't want to miss this stretch",subgoal
Very simple,side note
We're going to stretch our left side our left buttocks,instruction
We're going to lean back,instruction
We're going to bend this knee,instruction
"Our left knee and put it behind our right knee just like this, and we're going to grab underneath the leg and we're going to pull straight back",instruction
I'm going to come a little different angle.,transition
OK left knee is bent,description
Grab underneath the right thigh and pull straight back OK,instruction
Become a different angle here.,transition
OK left knee is bent behind the right knee,description
The right the ankle the left left ankle is behind the right knee and we're gonna pull straight back,instruction
Hold it about 2530 seconds and you can do both sides,instruction
The second stretch we're working the left side,subgoal
We're gonna take our left foot and put it on the other side of our right knee just like this,instruction
Now we're just going to grab with both hands the outside of the left knee and we're just going to pull it all the way over.,instruction
Are you going to hold it there a good 30 seconds?,instruction
Beautiful this whole that pull it all the way over,instruction
That's the right side,transition
Take the right foot over the left knee,instruction
Both hands and justice,instruction
Pull it over,instruction
Try to sit up as straight as you can and you'll feel the whole outside of the buttocks Just release ,instruction
the third exercise is just taking the side involved,subgoal
This is my left side,description
I'm going to work my left buttocks,instruction
"OK, we're going to bend that knee in front of us just like this as I show you here",instruction
Keep that back leg straight as possible.,instruction
Keeping your knee obviously behind you,instruction
"Keeping that back straight and all we're going to do is just lean our body forward, and if you can't go all the way down, just go down to the point to where you really feel that left buttocks burn",instruction
Right side Now ,transition
"got the right knee bent, left leg straight behind us arms resting on the floor and just leading forward leaning forward far as you can",instruction
"If you can go down all the way down, great, hold it there good 30 seconds and Relax.",instruction
the last exercise is taking a ball that you have,subgoal
"a tennis ball, a golf ball, a softball anything that's hard and firm lacrosse ball, something that we can put pressure and need that muscle.",tool (multiple)
and the way we're going to do this is a modification of the piriformis stretch but a little different,subgoal
and what we're going to do is we're going to work the left side OK,instruction
We're going to bend that left knee behind this.,instruction
"Right knee, we're just like this, we'll put that left ankle behind the right knee",instruction
"We're not going to really pull up much like we did before, but we're going to leave it like this and we're going to put the ball in that area",instruction
That's giving us problem that lower buttocks area to release that muscle,instruction
"And once it's in there, we're going to pull up a little bit",instruction
But we're just kind of kind of roll little circles.,instruction
"Good, it's just going to roll over that point",instruction
You can reposition it a different area.,instruction
And roll over that point and,instruction
the reason why we're bending this knee a little bit is that we want to take tension off the external rotators,justification
"OK, so as we do it, we're kind of taking tension off that muscle in the buttocks, as we're rolling that ball and little circles",justification
You can do that,filler
"Be a little creative, 30 seconds a minute, 2 minutes",instruction (multiple)
Just get to that area until you release that tight trigger point,instruction
So these are four great stretch exercises you can do to help.,reflection
Combat that sciatic lower back discomfort when those muscles contract are squeezing on those nerves,reflection

"Hi guys, it's Mimi here and welcome to people like Paul",greeting
I don't know why but I was in a 90s kind of mood today so this happened,side note
It's super funny,side note
"This week's tutorial is a bit different than what I usually make since this involves sewing and so fluffy socks, but I want to start off by saying an enormous gigantic.",briefing
Thank you to my mommy for coming over to help me figure out how we would put the hatchimals together and also for helping me suing them,side note
She is the best sewing Jedi master ever,side note
So tonight I'm showing you guys how to make your own hatchimal using some 40 cheap materials,goal
So it's like me you just can't afford a real hatchimal,motivation
Or maybe you have a hatchimal and would like to make her a little brother or sister,motivation
This superfamily alloy is just for you,motivation
I also prepare for you guys you print out with all the patterns you will need for this.,tool
"Project you will find a link to the print out in the description box below, so have fun and here we go",tool
First some of the materials you will need two fuzzy socks of any color you like,tool
A large plastic egg,tool
I bought mine at the dollar store,tool
"Some felt a glue gun, fabric, scissors, needle and thread and tacky",tool
"Glue glass stain, 3D paint and acrylic paint",tool
"A bit of polymer, clay and aluminum foil cotton wool filling and a print out of the pattern sheet I made just for you first",tool
Take this off you will use for the buddy measure 7 inches from the top.,instruction
And cut off the rest.,instruction
"Now start filling your sock with the cotton wool, giving it the texture you prefer, and use the circle pattern to trace and cut out the bottom of your hatchimal.",instruction
"Just secure the thread, leave a bit of thread and make three stitches at the same place",instruction
This way your thread won't unravel,justification
It can stitch in the soft fabric at about 1/4 inch from the edge,instruction
Then make another stitch in the felt again at 1/4 inch from the edge,instruction
Then keep going around the base until you only have a couple inches left before closing your work,instruction
"If necessary, add some filling in the body, then finish off the same way you started securing your thread",instruction (optional)
Now at this point some socks will naturally curl on top of the base like the White one did.,description
"But if the fabric sticks out like this one, simply glue the edge on top of the base like so",instruction
I'll use the stick to prevent burns from the evil glue gun,instruction
Now start a running stitch at 2 inches and a half from the top of the stock or the stick,instruction
Simply go in and out of the fabric in a straight line.,instruction
"Once you've come back to the starting point, start pulling very gently on your thread, which will slowly make a separation between the head and body",instruction
"Make sure you don't pull too much, since the original hatchimals have a very small gap between the head and body",instruction
Then don't forget to secure your thread,instruction
Now cut a second sock using the seven inches measure,instruction
Cut open the top part of the sock,instruction
Use the front front patterns to cut it out,instruction
"Now start sewing the fur in place by stitching a bit of body fabric, then a bit of fur fabric going from the right to the left or around the piece.",instruction
"Or the four tools Antenna Stick 2 pin needles where you want them to be, then pull on one end of a purple pipe cleaner through a large needle, then poke the needle through the two pin needle holes.",instruction
Measure about 2 inches on each side and cut off the excess,instruction
Then twist them in a swirl trace and cut out all the pieces for the burtles wings,instruction
Glue all the pieces in place.,instruction
Then paint a little flower into dust with puffy paint.,instruction
Trace and cut out the shell and paint the pattern again with some puffy paint and let the paint dry for a couple hours before handling them.,instruction
Trace and cut off the barricade swing pieces.,instruction
Then use the wing pattern to trace only the claws on pink felt,instruction
Cut them out and glue them on top of the wing,instruction
"Finally, paint on the little king does.",instruction
Cut out three white shapes for the barricades tail,instruction
Make little indents with your fabric scissors.,instruction
Then color the top of the fitters with pink soft,instruction
The stove threw them together with tacky glue and glue them on the hatchimal with a hot glue gun,instruction
Cut out the pieces for the ears,instruction
"Stick them together, then cover the edges with tacky glue so the fabric doesn't unravel",instruction
Blue all the wings in place using a stick to prevent burning yourself and glue on the shell on the hurdle for the beaks,instruction
Make a small cylinder with aluminum foil.,instruction
Then cover it with a thick sheet of polymer clay.,instruction
Roll it on your work surface,instruction
This without the imperfections,instruction
Then roll the tip a little more than the rest to make a bit of a cone shape,instruction
"Roll out a very small snake of clay, then stick it around the beak",instruction
"Take the beaks for 30 minutes, cut out the eye shapes and thin plastic",instruction
"Paint them the color you want, and once the paint is dry, paint on and black Oval.",instruction
That is small white dot poor multiple layers of glass stain on top.,instruction
Make sure your layers have dried overnight before handling the eye.,instruction
"For the egg, I simply painted the one I had with a couple layers of white paint.",instruction
Then I dipped the toothbrush and pink and black paint and brush the bristles of the toothbrush with a small stick to make some mini spots on the egg,instruction
Then I added more spots with the tip of the toothbrush and finally some little dots with a dotting tool,instruction
"Once the paint is dry, add a layer of glaze now to glue on the eyes and beaks",instruction
Cut out two more eye shapes and paper,instruction
"Then pin them on your hatchimal, which will help you stick them in the right places",instruction
Glue them all with hot glue.,instruction
There you go,outcome
Now you have your own handmade hatchimal plushie.,outcome

hello everyone,greeting
today we're going to be looking at the love monster which is one of my favorite books,briefing
it's by rachel bright and it features this adorable monster who lives in cutesy ville where everything in cutes ville is super cute and he doesn't feel very cute,background info
and so we're going to give him some love and attention by learning how to draw love monster today,goal
so i'm going to teach you how to start with a piece of paper and a pencil and you can put your love monster anywhere,goal
if you want to put them in the middle,briefing
if you want to put them on the side it's up to you,briefing
i think i'm just going to put mine on the side and maybe add some more details over here,briefing
so to start love monster,transition
we're going to start at the top of his head and when we're drawing something new,instruction
you want to draw a light,instruction
so i'm going to draw kind of a rounded rainbow line and his ears are triangles,instruction
i'm going to draw two triangles and then i'm going to come down and and just finish off his shape,instruction
he's got kind of a blocky rectangle shape,instruction
and then we're going to add his arms in his toes and everything,instruction
so we might have to do some racing today,instruction
i'm going to keep my eraser handy,side note
i'm going to give him his eyes and i notice that one eye is a little bit bigger than the other,instruction
which is so charming,side note
and these are the eyeballs,instruction
and now you can add the pupils and he can look kind of wherever he wants,instruction
like maybe mine's going to look over to the side and we'll give him some eyebrows,instruction
now he has this kind of lopsided face with these cute's sharp teeth sticking out,instruction
and then now we're going to put in his toes which are going to go along this line,instruction
and he has he's a three toed monster and so for the toes you're going to do the three circles for each foot,instruction
i'm going to erase that line in the middle there yup,instruction
and add in his toenails which are triangles so so add in those trying though,instruction
ok so now he has a little bit of a tail so you can make it come out on the side or come out on this side,early instruction (multiple)
but it's just going to go down like that,instruction
and then i will erase the slime,instruction
and now we need to add in his fuzzy arms,subgoal
so in one arm he does hold a teddy bear and i'll show you how to draw that one,subgoal
i'll leave a circle here to show the shape of the bear and then the arm is going to go around and these are going to be his fingers,instruction
he can grab his bear and we'll erase some of these lines,instruction
now if your love monster does not look like mrs,side note
belzer's or the or the monster in the book just turn it into your own love monster,side note
it doesn't have to look just like this one right,side note
you are artist,side note
you're going to make your own decisions on what to make here,side note
i'm just going to put in the face for his little bear which kind of looks like him,instruction
there we go,outcome
ok and then the other arm can be down at his side just down here,instruction
i will put in his my fingers and his fur,instruction
oh ok,filler
once you are done drawing love munster and you are happy with how he looks,description
oh i forgot something black monster because he's a love monster,justification
he has heart,instruction
ok anyway when you are done coloring love monster we're going to use oil pastels,tool
oil pastels are,tool
they're also called crepas,tool
they are crayons but there are more oily,tool
and so i'm going to because i'm using pink paper and use a color in the whites of his eyes,instruction
so i'll color of those in and and color in the rest of my monster,instruction
let's check it out in a second,transition
we have some more colored,outcome
and i did want to show you when you were coloring the big area,instruction
you can kind of go a little faster and i'm doing these up and down coloring lines because love monsters is pretty fuzzy,tip
but when you get close to another area like the eyes i don't want to accidentally get read into my eyes,tip
so you're gonna have to slow your tool down so that you can get around everything without accidentally going over,tip
oil pastel doesn't erase just like crayon doesn't erase,tip
and so you do want to go slow and just try your best when you get around these items,tip
all right we're going to keep going,transition
i'm this far now on my love monster,outcome
and now i'm going to go back with my black oil pastel,early instruction
because if you look at love monster he has this really dark outline around him ,justification
and so we can add that just by tracing everything and oil pastel,instruction
and love monsters kind of you know hairy looking ,justification
so your lines don't have to be very smooth,tip
you know you can add in some extra lines where you kind of go out a little bit and you want to make sure that anything you drew in pencil you're chasing,instruction
so that means you know around each toe and around each toe nail,instruction
that's a little extra work but it's so worth it,side note
it really makes if your image pop out and look finished,effect
so once you're finished tracing love monster you want to think about all that background space,subgoal
what are you going to draw back,subgoal
there,subgoal
are you going to draw another monster,instruction (multiple)
are you gonna draw him inside,instruction (multiple)
are you going to draw him outside,instruction (multiple)
maybe it's his birthday,instruction (multiple)
maybe,instruction (multiple)
maybe he's on the bus with his love monster,instruction (multiple)
girlfriend,instruction (multiple)
you know,filler
think about something that you want to use this space for,instruction
you,instruction
use your imagination,instruction
you can look at the book and add your own ideas and enjoy,instruction
"So hi guys, it's Lanie and ",greeting
today I'm going to be showing you how to make DIY hamster treats and ,goal
I'm so excited about this.,side note
"Because I love baking and this involves baking, so I'm also very sorry about the lighting",side note
Kind of like 9:00 o'clock at night,side note
Right now it was probably best so that we could try it out on chip,side note
"So yeah, I hope you like the video",side note
Let's get started,transition
"The things I'm using are two bowls, a half, a cup of pellets, 1/3 cup of all-purpose flour, a fork.",tool
A cookie cutter and lastly a Benihana,tool
So the first thing I'm doing is preheating my oven to 350 degrees.,instruction
So the first thing you want to do is pour your pellets into a plastic bag,instruction
"Oh yeah, and by the way, the pellets I'm using are the new garden select Oxbow pellets.",tool
Now I'm shutting the bag.,instruction
And now I'm going to just crush up all these pellets until they're in like a fine powdery consistency.,instruction
"So I finally completed crushing all these pellets up and they don't have to be completely crushed,",outcome
just taking my bowl and I'm just going to put them in there.,instruction
So this is what they should look like.,outcome
So now you're going to add the third cup of flour to that.,instruction
So by now it should look something like this.,description
So now I'm just going to set this whole side.,instruction
And get my new bowl,instruction
So now I'm peeling my banana and just putting it inside the bowl,instruction
So now I'm just going to use the fork and just kind of smash it.,instruction
This is what it will probably look like when you finish mashing it up,outcome
So now you're just going to take your dry bowl and you're just going to.,instruction
Put the banana into that.,instruction
"Ohh, now you want to mix both ingredients together until it forms a dough consistency.",instruction
So I'm I'm getting kind of impatient using the fork,side note
I think I'm just going to go in with my hands now.,side note
So my dough is basically completely needed.,outcome
So I'm just going to put it down on the table.,instruction
And just.,instruction
Flatten it completely out.,instruction
So I have finished kind of flattening it out and now I'm going to take my heart-shaped cookie cutter.,instruction
And just start.,instruction
Cutting little.,instruction
Cookies out.,instruction
"So I just have this extra crumbly dough that is kind of hardened so it's not very useful anymore, so I'm just going to throw this away and ",instruction
then we're going to put our little hearts onto a baking sheet and bake them for 30 minutes.,early instruction
"So this is totally optional, but I'm just putting a little.",instruction (optional)
Pumpkin seed and all of my little treats.,instruction (optional)
So I have chip out right now and we are going to go ahead and try his the treats on him,description
He is and here's the treat.,side note
You like your treat buddy.,side note
Funny.,side note
You know?,side note
Should be 2/2 hi.,side note
He loves the thing so much.,side note
He just got out of the sand bath.,side note
And he has gotten sand all over me,side note
"Sorry buddy, you're not gonna be able to touch that.",side note
Bring this thing everywhere.,side note
We decided where to eat it.,side note
welcome back you guys to another episode of elite fishing bros,greeting
today we have something very special planned,greeting
this episode is the first episode of a new series called the tank build up series and what i'm going to be doing in this series is building up my tank,greeting
catching fish raising them in the tank raising different plants,goal
it's going to be a great time,goal
the fish that i am planning on putting in this tank include blue gill bass and perch,tool
and when i say blue gill bass and perch i mean it's really small,tool
bluegill bass and perch,tool
i'm going to try and keep it to a limit of three to four inches inside of this tank,tool
anything bigger than that will not sustain in this tank,tool
i'm not sure how many fish i'm going to put in this tank probably around two or three,tool
but that's even going to stretch a limit,tool
anyway guys let's get to it all right guys,transition
so as you can see right here behind me i got my twenty gallon long tank,tool
i got it at petco for about twenty dollars,tool
they were having a sale one dollar per gallon so i had to get it and then over to my left,tool
here i got the filter,tool
i have the rocks and i have the structure that i'm gonna be putting inside the tank,tool
now don't worry guys i'm gonna talk about each one of those components later,transition
but let's get started all right,transition
so we're going to start off with the rocks,transition
we're going to open the bag up and just start pouring it in,instruction
i got a twenty pound bag of fresh water slash salt water rocks at petco for around nineteen dollars,tool
and knowing that i'm going to put a bass the perch or a blue gill in this tank,justification
i got the sand colored rocks because that will best suit their habitat that they are in right now,tool
so after i'm done pouring that in i'm going to start spreading it around with my hands,instruction
and the goal is to actually move the rocks on a slope from the front to the back so it adds a little bit more depth in your tank,effect
alright once you're done with that you're going to want to add your structure,subgoal
now be really creative with this,subgoal
and this is what i found,tool
so i found this log that has sort of a hole in it so the fish can go in there for cover,tool
and it's also long enough to fit in the width of my tank which is pretty cool,tool
but first we have to cure this,subgoal
so i'm going to show you guys how to cure it really quick and then we're going to put it in the tank,subgoal
so what you're going to want to do is get your biggest pot in the house and fill it up with water,early instruction
leave a little room for the wood because once you put the wood in the water's going to rise just a little bit,early instruction
let that water boil then put your wood in,early instruction
try to put it in twenty minutes total,early instruction
so you're going to want to do ten minutes each time if it won't fit in the pot,early instruction
and after that take it out and you are good to go,early instruction
the reason that we're boiling this wood right now is to get rid of all the unnecessary bacteria that may do harm to your plants and your fish,justification
all right,filler
so while that water's boiling we're going to talk about this filter that i got i personally got a thirty gallon filter for the twenty gallon tank,tool
you guys are like what should have spent ten dollars less than twenty gallon,tool
well i always heard that it's better to over filter than to under filter or to even go to the level that through our filtering,justification
so i got the thirty gallon filter right here,tool
we're going to open it up and put it on,subgoal
all right,filler
so when you first open this thing up it's going to be pretty big actually,tool
oh my gosh it looks like the tops coming out,tool
first take the filter out of the box all right,instruction
so you got a bunch of stuff in the package that you just got in your filter box,description
i'm going to open up the instructions and read but it's got to say all right,instruction
so the first step is to check and see if there's any damage done to your filter,instruction
alright so step two it says to remove new cartridge from bag and rinse under cold water to remove carbon dust,instruction
step three install cartridge as shown,instruction
all right,filler
then it says to slide it in here,instruction
you're going to see two slots that you slide it into and bam that looks like it's done,outcome
step four if the pump is already assembled check the correct position of it,instruction
it was not already assembled but we just did that,side note
all right,filler
and then it comes with this piece that was not very specified in the instructions but looks like it just slides in here like that and you're good to go,tool
alright a kind of just found the secret compartment inside the filter,tool
so if you reach in the right hand corner of the filter you're going to find this,instruction
this is crucial,description
i thought i didn't have it for a second but it's in the corner,description
looks like it just snaps on it,description
then the last thing you're gonna do is put the roof on the filter,instruction
that's pretty self explanatory,side note
so once you have your filter all set up and ready to go all you're going to do is take the filter and place it right over the tank like that,instruction
i'm going to put it on the left side and you are good to go,outcome
all right you guys to,outcome
the log is finally done boiling,outcome
but what i am going to do is i'm going to take a paper towel and just start rubbing away that extra stuff that needs to come off like that,instruction
big jump just came off all right,description
so once you have all the extra wood and dirt off of your cover then you're going to want to put it in your tank,subgoal
now be really creative with this,tip
so that it really draws the eye to the back of the tank kind of what i did with the sand,effect
that looks pretty good right there,outcome
and the reason i chopped it is because my original plan was to tie something on that would weigh it down,justification
huh,filler
and and the reason i positioned it slammed like that is so i can add depth to the tank,justification
so now that we have everything situated in the tank we are going to add the water conditioner,subgoal
looks like you just pour it right in there just like that,instruction
so we're going to place this plant in there right along the edge here,instruction
put some rocks to weigh it down and that should be good right there,instruction
make sure to stay tuned for my next video where i go out catch a fish and put it in this tank,outro
thank you for watching,outro

"Pulling off a good green screen starts with the correct setup and not only saves you time and stress and boost, but also gives you way better results",motivation
So let's head over to the garage,transition
ant to take a step by step note to achieve a great green screen on a budget.,goal
Hey folks Jordan here for cinecom.net and welcome to the channel that is all about creative filmmaking with premiere Pro and Basic Phillip equipment,greeting
We shoot all of our episodes in our Green Screen studio,side note
"We've made a permanent setup, but for the purpose of this tutorial, we'll make a new setup and a more common environment",briefing
"Most of us don't have access to expensive studio equipment, so that's why we're going to set-up a green screen.",motivation
"In the garage, for most homes this is usually a dark place or it only has some small windows which we could easily tape off",description
"The idea is to start from a blank page, which means a completely dark room ",briefing
"setting up a green screen is rather simple, but lighting it is a different story",briefing
"Later in this video you'll see that we have to create two lighting zones, which means we're going to need some space as well",briefing
Your talent has to take some distance from the green screen and the camera too,justification
"So not only we need a dark room, but also the space.",justification
You put up everything which recommends to have at least 4 meters or about 13 feet from the wall to wall,briefing
and this tutorial video you'll see that we'll be using all sorts of materials from the garage,briefing
"There are hundreds of ways to put up and light a green screen, so your situation might be a little different on what you have laying around at home",briefing
but it's important to follow the techniques shown so you can get similar results,briefing
So we've got a room,tool
The next thing is the green screen itself,tool
Now this fabric is not something special.,tool
"If you like, you can also get this at a local fabric store, but I would suggest to just get a real green screen as they are actually pretty cheap",tool (multiple)
"You can find fabrics for as low as 20 bucks or even 50 bucks for a whole set with stands and everything, but the way everything mentioned here is listed in the description below",tool
The way you set-up your green screen doesn't matter that much with is important though is that you don't see any wrinkles,early instruction
"In other words, make sure to tighten this screen",early instruction
This is best done by having two stands and one pole on top of that.,instruction
Then use some clamps to stretch and tighten the fabric,instruction
"You can also craft a wooden frame and tighten your green screen in there, but it's less portable",instruction (optional)
"Basically, anything will do just as long as you can tighten the fabric",justification
This was the easy part,side note
Now comes the lighting which will make the difference between a good or bad Chroma Key,subgoal
"And like I said before, we're going to create two lighting zones, one for the green key and one for the subject, and it's important that they don't interfere with each other, but.",subgoal
Let's start with the first zone,subgoal
Lighting the green screen ,subgoal
like you might have heard somewhere else,filler
It's important to light the fabric evenly over the whole surface,early instruction
"You want to avoid having hotspots, which means that there are spots which are more illuminated than the rest of the surface",instruction
"You want to have at least one light at each site,",early instruction
but even then it's sometimes hard to spread the light evenly over the surface,description
This is why we're going to create a large softbox ,early instruction
"when light is diffused, it spreads better over the surface.",justification
Cheapest solution is to hang a white cloth and each science and place your lights behind it,instruction
I have attached two work lights to each site so that I both illuminate the top and the bottom of the screen,instruction
This technique will work with any kinds of lights,tool (multiple)
If you have some light bulbs laying around or like to craft something of your own it will work perfectly,tool (multiple)
"Those who like to learn more about using work lights like we do for video, just click on a cart up there to learn more",background info
You can of course also use LED panels here and they can't even be of a lower quality.,tool (multiple)
"Cheap LED lights will cast green colors, but since they're pointing towards a green screen it doesn't really matter that much",tool (multiple)
Lighting zone one is complete,outcome
Make sure to check if the lighting is even over the whole surface,early instruction
You can do that by quickly keying it and post and see how it goes,early instruction
"If you notice differences there, adjust the position and the angle of your lighting",early instruction
"We're halfway, so let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor of this video",transition
"If you like to advertise on Facebook, make sure it's a little video and attracts a lot more attention.",side note
And video blogs,side note
We can find this awesome Starburst clip,side note
"Drag it into premiere pro, but make sure that you're working in a square resolution, for example 1080 by 1080",side note
This is best for mobile users as everyone holds their phone vertically,side note
Then enter text to it and upload it to facebook visit video blogs.com for more templates and stock footage,side note
Full link in the description below,side note
Welcome back everyone,transition
Let's take a look at lighting zone #2 now this is going to be the lighting on your subject,subgoal
"First of all, you want to make sure that the Right from the green screen is not interfering,",early instruction
so trying to find a spot where the reflection from behind is as minimum as possible,instruction
You might need to flap off any spill light with a black fabric or some carton boards,instruction (optional)
"Once you've got that out of the way, we can focus on the subject, ",description
"but also here with the subject lighting you want to make sure that it's not interfering with the green screen light, so that's vice versa",early instruction
"A common mistake is that your subjects will cast shadows on the green screen, and you want to avoid that at any cost.",tip
Q Easy Solutions is to take distance from the green screen and to use soft lights on the front of the subject,tip
You're basically two kinds of lightings,background info
"A basic illumination for presentations like the three-point lighting setup, and again you can click in the cards up there to learn more about that or a certain setup that matches the light scene of what's going to be your backgrounds",background info
"For example, if our background is a sunset at the beach, then make sure to add that sunlight on the subject as well",background info
You wouldn't have a warm heart.,background info
Why it's coming from the back and a soft fill light from the opposite side to lift up the shadows? ,background info
Very important here though is that we must pay attention to the type of lighting we use on the green screen,background info
You have daylights and tungsten lights,background info
"If you use tungsten lights in the background, then we have to change our wide balance to it",background info
This makes those warm lights appear as natural white in camera,background info
This is very important to capture a vivid green color,background info
"If your white balance is set wrong, you will have a mix between yellow.",background info
"Against Green, which is going to be a lot harder to key in post",background info
"So if you have tungsten lighting in the back which appears as natural light and camera, your subject lights will also appear colder than reality",background info
If you like warm colors on your subject then you might need to add some orange filters in front of those lights to get a warm tune,background info
"So even though you're too, lighting zones are separated, you need to adjust the color temperature to each other",background info
If you follow these steps you should be able to get a good green.,outcome
"Being result now, those with some budget who would like to build out a more permanent studio",background info
You can also again click on a cart up there to see a video on how we've built our Green screen studio,background info
"Everything I've been talking about it can be found in the description below, and",background info
if you have any more questions and also make sure to put them in the comments section,outro
Thank you so much for watching.,outro
And stay creative.,outro
how did you start painting murals,greeting
so the question i asked myself for years before i got this gig and this gig this past summer,greeting
i hope i can answer some of your questions,goal
alright guys let's get into it,transition
how do you start painting murals and want to start from a beginner's perspective,goal
when you first start out you really have to have solid ability on paper on canvas on a smaller scale before you even think about going any larger,early instruction
so what are some of your options,transition
i went to college in the boston area massachusetts really near talem beverly and in beverly there is this legal wall,reflection
they call it free wall the graffiti wall and they also call it life hall of famer,reflection
and that was where i really got their first shot at what it was like to paint something larger,reflection
and it was amazing,reflection
it was exciting but i was also extremely lucky to have that fifteen minutes away because i probably did ten to twenty pieces on that wall,reflection
here's the thing,reflection
you're not going to be able to keep,reflection
it's it's not,reflection
we're not able to keep the peace it's not going to stay on the wall,reflection
i even a lot of times paying a piece,reflection
that next weekend i rolled over the piece i created i would destroy the and that's something that could be pretty hard,reflection
you destroy the piece you create but after a while it becomes a habit,reflection
and the real key is you're documenting it via photography,late instruction
all right,filler
and so where i was initially just shooting it off my iphone i now have a professional grade dsr hairless camera that i'm taking my shots with,tool (multiple)
so that's key is producing and documenting,reflection
now they're like hey i don't have a legal free wall near me,description
i went on legal walls dot net,description
i couldn't find anything,description
what are my other options,subgoal
another option is to find yourself a plywood board,tool (multiple)
yeah just a plywood board,tool (multiple)
go to home depot go to your local hardware store and start painting on a plywood board,tool (multiple)
a lot of the early works that i did were really not that much taller than me,tool (multiple)
a couple of things here as well,tool (multiple)
i started using spray paint,tool (multiple)
there were a lot of muralists who were not even using spray paint where they're just using rollers and they're using paint brushes,tool (multiple)
so don't be restricted by that,tool (multiple)
but i have a huge tip for you guys who are really into the spray paint,tool (multiple)
just as i was,tool (multiple)
and that is cello art cello graffiti,tool (multiple)
let me show you what that looks like,transition
boom,filler
here it is sello artillery affitti,tool
this i got a local hardware store,tool
it's just like plastic wrap,tool
this i gotten molotovs are actually a it's at a physical store but you can probably get this stuff online,tool
and this is also sell oprah,tool
but this is in black so you can be painting from dark to light,tool
for beginners this is really a great way to go ,tip
once you build up some sort of base of portfolio this is how we really when the momentum when you start to snowball effects happens,instruction
because you can start pitching projects to people,effect
for example i pitched a project to an organization in sri lanka,reflection
so really quite a long story,reflection
but in the end i was able to go around sri lanka and paint in local schools and do relatively large scale,reflection
girls what did this do,reflection
well it built up my portfolio even further to then pitch other projects and do other things,reflection
i end up traveling to finland and made my own project and this is really what's important here,reflection
art is flexible and it's in in a certain way,side note
it's really about people's perceptions of what you're doing,side note
you don't have to actually necessarily have a legitimate project to make it seem legitimate in the eyes of others,side note
so i went to finland,reflection
i found multiple free walls,reflection
again legal walls dot net,tip
you can see a lot more,tip
free wall is actually in finland and i built up my portfolio even further,reflection
it's a long story but i had to actually moving to finland and i continue to build my portfolio,reflection
but this time with slightly more organized events,reflection
so there was a block party and i got to paint this truck,reflection
and then there was an event where a group of guys were able to get a building that they were going to tear down,reflection
the piece that i did there became really popular in the city and the next year i was asked by the same group of guys and they had one spot for an artist to go on a lift and do a piece,reflection
so they called me and he said hey can you give it a shot and i asked like yeah for for somebody,reflection
yeah of course,reflection
i've been waiting past three years to to to get on a lift which for me was really deciding factor because on a lift you're really quite close to the wall and you have to really get all the way down to look back at your art,reflection
so got the opportunity,reflection
i hustled,reflection
i like only two and a half days to do it,reflection
i was painting in the night with the headlamp,reflection
it was a crazy story,reflection
i nailed the mural and it actually got on the cover of the local newspaper,reflection
so then some of the companies that were in the area thought one of the owners said this is a sick idea,reflection
i want this guy to paint one of my buildings and that's as of that was a couple of months ago and that was an incredible opportunity because that was my first paid mural gig,reflection
and that was,reflection
i think it was about three or four stories high that the building and so again awesome,reflection
big time for that and and it was just an incredible experience,reflection

hey there i'm alan matthews from classical guitar shed and in this video we're going to be looking at a capo,greeting
in this video we're going to be looking at a capo,goal
what is a capo,goal
why would you use a capo,goal
how do you use a capo,goal
do i need a capo,goal
all these questions and more will be answered in just a second,transition
so why would you use this,subgoal
well there are a few different ways,description
few different reasons why you would actually use a capo,description
first off is if you are playing chords along with a singer or something like that and you're playing along and they say,subgoal
a little bit more so it's a little bit instead of having and then you could bring it up a couple of frets and it's just a little bit brighter,description
so that's one of the reasons that a lot of flamenco players will use this as well,justification
i don't know if that's a reason that flamingo players do it or not but it's a benefit because it just makes the instrument a little bit easier to get around on right here,justification
so that's the second reason,transition
a third reason is that a composer you piece of classical guitar music or something a composer may use this for a particular reason,subgoal
and so it will just make the instrument sound like a higher pitched instrument ,effect
it's the exact same thing it's called affected guitar and it is just a special technique and very cool,background info
so beware of that possible pitfall or just move it around enough that you get really versatile playing with a capo,tip
so hope you've enjoyed this foray into capos,outro
alright please subscribe to this channel and i'll talk to you soon,outro
bye k,outro
