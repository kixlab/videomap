2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"Hey, what's up everybody I'm Tommy",greeting
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,and today I'm going to show you how I made this vice mounted router table with built in dust collection,goal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"Whether it's your first time here or even if you've been here before, welcome to one Minute Workbench.",greeting
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"So when I started out building this router table, I actually intended on it just being a temporary jig, but during the building process it sort of evolved into this fully featured router table",briefing
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I started off by cutting a piece for the mounting block and a piece for the main surface of the router table.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I checked to see that the router would have plenty of room and make sure that the device would not interfere with its operation,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,Then I secured the two pieces together.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"Everywhere I used screws, I made sure to drill pilot holes and counter sinks.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I chose a bit that was larger than my largest router, bit marked a hole in the center of the table, and then drilled it out on the drill press.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I lowered the bit into the hole to help me align the router to the approximate center with the router and the approximate center,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I marked the mounting thread locations with a pencil.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I picked a forstner bit large enough to accommodate the tool for the bolt heads, and then drill the holes.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I finished drilling the holes with a 5 sixteenths inch bit to match the size of the mounting bolts.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I realized though that the mounting holes on the router were not symmetric, so I had to do it again",description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,Starting from the bottom of the table.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I mounted the router in place, set the bit depth for a roundover and gave it a preliminary test.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"It was all looking good, so I decided to make a fence.",subgoal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"At first I just clamped the fence in place to test it since that was working well, I figured I might as well continue and make it adjustable.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I just copied the cut out from the fence to the fence base.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"Now I'm doing these cuts with a bandsaw, but you could easily do these with a jigsaw or a coping saw.",tool (multiple)
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"With the fence built, I started working on the adjustment knobs.",subgoal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I rounded all of the corners using my homemade disc Sander.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"Since I had the Sander out, I took the opportunity to go ahead and round over all the other sharp corners.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I glued up the knobs and then set those aside to dry.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"While the knobs were drying, I took some measurements and determined where I wanted the mounting bolts for the adjustable fence.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I added mounting bolts, but I'm not going to go into detail on this because as you'll see in just a bit I ended up changing this feature.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I needed to add slots so I scored a line and then drilled 1/2 inch hole in the center of that line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"With a half inch bit installed in the router, I use the hole to install a temporary fence for cutting the slots.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"Right when I finished making the knobs, I realized I wanted to change things so that the bolts were part of the knobs and not part of the table",subgoal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,So I removed the bolts and drilled out large counter bores in the mounting block,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,This allowed me to use T nuts and the mounting block.,effect
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"To make the new knobs, I drilled 1/2 inch counter bore and A5 sixteenths inch through hole in the main component and then drill to 5/8 inch hole in a smaller bottom component",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,This will make sense in just a little bit.,transition
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,The hole in the knob is intentionally left a little bit smaller than the points of the hex bolt,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,This lets you hammer the bolt in place and lets the wood form a nice snug fit.,effect
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"To make sure the bolt didn't back out, I used a nylon lock nut.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I of course rounded all the corners and then added the bottom components to the knobs.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I scored a center line on a small scrap and then transferred the center line all the way around the ends.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,Then I used a pencil just to darken the center line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I very carefully drilled 1/2 inch hole in the center of that line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I mounted the router in place, inserted the bit into the piece and squared the piece with the outside edge of the table",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,Then I made marks to match the center line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I carefully transfer the center line to the table itself,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,This gave me a mark that is aligned with the center of the bit.,effect
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"To test out the mark, I used a very accurate ruler to set the depth of the fence to three inches",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I made a test cut and then measured it with a half inch bit,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,The measurement to the inside edge should be 2.75 inches,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"It looked really close, so I measured it with a caliper.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"As you can see here, it's within 2007 inch which is really close with the success of the first few cuts I decided to build the rulers right into the table.",description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,These steel rulers were just a dollar each at harbor freight,tool
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I took some basic measurements and cut them down to size using a pair of tin snips.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,Then I use the rulers themselves as a guide for drawing the marks,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I would need to embed them in the table.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I carefully aligned a scrap of wood and clamped it in place so it could work as a guide for my router.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I set the router's bit so that it would cut a slot just a little bit deeper than the thickness of the ruler.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I then repeated the process for the other side.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I added hot glue to the slot and set the ruler in place,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,Unfortunately I was moving kind of slow here and the glue actually set-up before I could get the ruler pressed all the way down,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,So I used a heat gun to soften the glue so I could push the ruler down until it was flush with the table.,tip
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I thought it would be quicker on the second one, but I wasn't and wound up having to use the heat gun again.",tip
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,The heat gun did the trick and the rulers were perfectly flush with the table top.,outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I removed the excess glue from the rulers with a little bit of Windex.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I added the router back in place and used the alignment block to make sure the router was perfectly centered with the line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,My first Test cut was at 2 inches and with a half inch bit,outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"When measured to the first edge should be 1.75 inches and as you can see here, the result was within 5 thousandths of an inch, which is very good.",outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"With the accuracy on point, I turned my attention to creating dust collection dust collection around the router itself is the trickiest part, so I started with that for this first cut",subgoal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I was able to trace the outline of the router and cut it out on the bandsaw with a little bit of back and forth,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I was able to get a nice fit.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I then worked on the upright walls of the box, which I just had to eyeball and make some test cuts on again",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,With a little bit of back and forth,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,It was done in just a few minutes.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"The rest of the box was just small square pieces, so I cut those out and started assembling it.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I traced out the top of the box and trimmed it to match the rest of the pieces.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I changed my mind about the side I wanted the vacuum on,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,So I plugged the original vacuum hole.,instructional (optional)
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I cut a few small blocks that would allow a threaded knob to hold the box in place.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I then added a tee nut that would accept the threaded knob.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I marked the threaded rod with a Sharpie so I could see where to trim it and then trimmed it with a hacksaw.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"And for safety, I filed the sharp edges until they were smooth.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I added some foam to the edges of the box where it contoured to the shape of the router.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I then added a small wooden block and used some hot glue to attach a foam block that would cover the last remaining opening.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,These small guide blocks will just make it easier to properly align the box.,justification
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,The bottom dust collection box allows the router to be lowered and raised while the box is in place.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"With the bottom dust collection box and the vacuum line in place, I made a test cut",outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"It didn't collect all the dust, but I would say it got about 75%.",outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,The threaded knob allows me to quickly remove and replace the box when I need to change router bits.,outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,The top dust collection box was a lot easier than the bottom one,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"I just glued it, clamped it in place and let it dry for about an hour.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,This top dust collection box is perfect for round overs and pretty much collects 100% of the dust.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"With everything working good, I took it all apart and prepped it for finishing for finishing",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I applied 6 coats of satin water based polyurethane and sanded in between coats.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,I'm really happy with how the router table turned out,outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"As I mentioned before, it was just going to be a temporary jig, but I'm happy that I took the time to go ahead and build some more features into it.",reflection
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden.xlsx,"Hey, thanks for watching",outro

mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,hello,greeting
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,do it yourselfers,greeting
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,i'm terry peterman the internet electrician,greeting
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,welcome to another one of my video shorts on current topics,greeting
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,let's get started all right,transition
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,in this short video we're going to troubleshoot a desk lamp here,goal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,when we arrived at our place here in costa rica this lamp worked just fine,motivation
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so what went wrong,motivation
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,well first of course the most obvious thing is to check is the light bulb and and i changed the bulb and still no functiona on this one,late instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so let's try and swap it with one that we absolutely know works,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,is you never know when you get a bad bulb,jusitification
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so we'll switch the one out of the bad lamp,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,put it in the one we know it works and it does it,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,and and the one we know was working,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,still nothing,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so we're plugged into the same outlet,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,i guess you can always try that because sometimes and this is actually a good tip,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,lots of times in homes you're going to find that half of the outlets are switched and half as hot all the time,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,half is on a wall switch,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so just to make sure that's not the case here which i know it isn't,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,but what you want to do is swap them then you're sure,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so we've swapped the lamps and that one still works and not outlet,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,and this one doesn't,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so what we've got to do is take this lamp apart find out what went wrong,subgoal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so one thing you want to do is examine the socket inside of the the lamp here,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,now you can see this point right in there that makes contact with the center of the bulb,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,that's your heart and this is your neutral that touches the shell of the light bulb itself,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,one thing i notice here i don't see any burnt points like lots of times,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,you'll find that rivet down here on the on,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,the center pin is corroded so that can cause you problems,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,that's one thing to check,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,the center pin should also have some spring to it not be all soft and malleable but this is good,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,it's spring steel and here make sure that there's no corrosion on what makes contact with the shell of the bulb for the neutral,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,all that seems good in this one but i did notice the socket is loose,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so if you look right down in here there's a phillips and a standard blade screw head machine screw head that's loose,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so we're just gonna tighten that up a little and that makes the socket nice and tight in there,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,we'll bend it back to the center position so that's not the problem,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,we're going to take the base off this lamp and see if something went wrong with the switch,subgoal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so again with the lamp unplugged,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,as you can see there's three screw holes here that just hold this plastic base on,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,remove those i've got them all loosened up,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,take the base off and have a look and right away i see what the problem is,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,i let me bring you in for a close up of this,transition
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so here's the rocker switch that turns this lamp on and off,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,you'll notice on the other one it's an inline lamp cord switch that operates it,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,but this one's got a a switch on the base,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,well as soon as i pulled that base off you can see what the problem is,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,this is just a simple single pole switch single pole rocker switch and this brown wire was popped right off of a terminal of the switch,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,soul,filler
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,the neutral is carried right on through to the lamp socket and it's fine but we got to resolder that wire on to that,early instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,there you go to that little terminal right there,early instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,and once we do that i'm sure this lamp will work,effect
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so i just need to add a little bit of solder to these connections,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so i've got my iron nice and hot here,tool
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,now you'll see,transition
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,i'm just going to touch the solder to the tip make sure that it's hot enough to melt,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,solder and it is,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so there's probably some residual solder left on the terminal but i'll add a little bit anyway,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so what you want to do is touch your iron down to the wire and the terminal and they need to to both get hot enough to,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,you'll see the sodder flow into the terminal when things are hard enough and i'll touch up to the other terminal as well,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,too much there,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,you don't want too much solder just enough to i just enough to flow into the wire and the terminal,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,there i saw it,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,i saw it flow into the terminal,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,i think that's about as close as i can get that shot blow on it cool it off a little bit,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,and i see that switch is a little bit loose in there but i have a good solder job between the wire and the terminal,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so now that i've got my soldering complete you can see it's all nice and tight on that terminal,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,and that one's good,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,now before i put the base on i'm just going to test the lamp and make sure it works,subgoal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,and then we'll put it all back together,subgoal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,so i haven't put the bass back on yet just in case there's still something wrong,jusitification
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,but let's test our lamp out and it works as it should be and the other one's working so we can put that bass back on,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,and we've saved ourselves a few bucks,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden.xlsx,it's not an expensive lamp but in this day and age of throwaway society you can see just how simple it can be to repair something like this instead of tossing it out,reflection

oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,welcome to specific love today,greeting
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,i'm gonna show you how i built this awesomely simple air filtration system that will do great at removing dust from your workshop or your garage,goal
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,let's begin now if you ask about any woodworker what is one of the major issues you have in the shop,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,that would be dust collection,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,dust gets everywhere it's in just in the air,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,when you're especially if you're using the table saw or miter saw which is really hard,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,even with a good dust collection system it's very hard to even get it to collect even most of the dust,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,now i've used a simple four billion that i've tried to have it just a basic filter on to see if that would help,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,and it just crap gets stuck all in this filter,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,and i don't believe the fan is working at top efficiency,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,so trying to help solve that problem i found this huge four by filter which should give a lot more surface area and a lot more ability for this simple little fan to pull it through,tool
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,hopefully in the sense cleaning out a lot more of the air and getting rid of a lot of that dust,tool
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,now to do that i'm going to build a box around this filter and this fan try and house everything just in one type area,subgoal
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,so i first started ripping some two by fours down into some one and a half inch strips,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,this will allow the frame to be strong and relatively light,effect
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,plus i can keep the wood needed to a minimum and if you look here you should also be able to see all of the dust floating in the air just from cutting a simple board,justification
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,description
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,and then measured the fan and filter and cut the wood into the needed lanks,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,a quick test fit showed that the cuts were acceptable and,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,now it did drill pilot holes for all of the screws to help avoid splitting which can be common in pine lumber,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,i then completed the second frame for the other side,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,to connect the frames i added two more wood strips to the bottom and two to the top,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,so be careful when you're trying to rip me two by fours,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,so be very careful whenever you're using a table,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,saw that real dangerous things can't happen so always be as safe as possible,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,once the frame was secure i grabbed the fans and filter for a test fit and they slid in well,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,now to give the structure more strength and keep the fan and filter from falling out it needed a floor and back wall,justification
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,if you have not seen that funny video i will put a link in the description i think,side note
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,cut out the floor and secured in place with a few screws,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,so i cut down some more plywood and attach the top and the back with several more screws,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,now to keep the fan and filter from falling out of the sides of the frame during transport or getting bumped,justification
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,i added a sidebar on both sides,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,she doesn't agree but she doesn't want to tell you you're wrong,side note
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,yeah one of those,side note
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,so i asked well what color would you paint it and she said how about brown,side note
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden.xlsx,,
,,now i did discover something that actually pretty cool about first painting this orange and then painting it brown,tip
,,it may be hard to tell in the video but it turned out almost a cherry type color which is really cool hack,tip
,,so if you ever need to make a cherry tight color and all you have and the have is orange and brown,tip
,,do a nice thick layer of orange and then just a light coating of brown and it should come out pretty cool,tip
,,now to help with the filtration i wanted a way to help prevent the large particles from reaching a filter,justification
,,so i grabbed some old window screen,tool
,,waved it around the side support and stapled it to the inside of the frame to keep the exterior looking uniform,instruction
,,now to keep the fan and filter from falling out of the front of the frame i decided to add a small bungee cord,instruction
,,so i've tapped in a couple nails in the back sides of the front supports and the cord could be attached or removed easily,instruction
,,yeah yeah,filler
,,now that we know this works we have easy access to change the filters,outcome
,,and it's pretty lightweight because it is just simple two by fours that i have cut down into one and a half inch strips,outcome
,,so if you have a great idea of where to put this where the hang this or where ever you think i should do it,outro
,,please put a comment down below and tell me what you think,outro
,,if you enjoyed this project make sure you also click the like button,outro
,,also have some videos right over here that you might like to make sure you check those out,outro

dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Hey guys, it's Sandy",greeting
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Welcome back to cute Polish,greeting
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,In today's video we're going to be talking about dip powder,goal
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Nails dip powder has been all the rage this year, but the application of it can sometimes get tricky",motivation
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,so Julie will be sharing her tips and tricks today on how to perfect your dip powder manicure at home,goal
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Hey, it's Julie now let's get started with the video",transition
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"First things first, you're going to need a dip powder kit",tool
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"There are a lot of options right now, but for this video I'll be using the Kira sky.",tool (multiple)
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Kid, because it comes with everything you need and it's packaged and easy steps one through 5 bottles ",justification
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,as you would with any manicure you're going to want to start with cleaned groomed nails,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,This means push your cuticles back,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,File your nails into shape and remove any residue from the nail plate.,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"This particular kit comes with step by step instructions for how to use the dip powder, which I do follow, but I have learned a couple things that weren't mentioned in the instructions, which I will share with you a little later",tool
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,The first step is to apply a thin layer of bonder,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"This is basically just a dehydrator and it's going to remove the excess oils from your nails to make sure the dip powder adheres properly, but don't panic",effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,This is supposed to leave your nails looking pale and really dried out,effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Step 2 is to apply the base.,subgoal
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Polish to 3/4 of your nail, then quickly dip it into the natural colored dip powder",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,This is going to help disguise any visible nail line you have and make the final color more opaque and even,effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"It doesn't say this in the instructions, but you have to work one nail at a time because the base dries fairly quickly and you need to get that powder on while it's still wet, or else it will not stick at all",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Another thing I don't think the instructions clearly state is to dip your finger in at about a 45 degree angle until it's completely submerged in the powder and then pull it out.,tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Tap off the excess powder and let it dry while you move on to the next nails,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Tapping your finger will remove the majority of the loose powder, but there might be quite a bit still stuck to your nail",effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"So what I like to do is, once the base and first layer of powder are dry, maybe about two or three minutes, I'll take a big kabuki brush and dust off the excess",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,This will keep the layers thin and keep product from building up on your brushes,effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Now you can grab the colored dip powder,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"I'll be using this deep red shade that's funnily named hot chocolate, and just like before.",tool
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Apply the base, but this time you can apply it to your entire nail and then dip it into the colored powder",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Word of caution, these powders are extremely pigmented, so you're going to get some color on your skin, but it will wash off later with soap.",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"If you see any spots you might have accidentally missed, it's OK to add a little more of the base than dip it again",instruction (optional)
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Here's where I ran into problems when I first did this,reflection
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"If you applied the base over top of your first coat of color and there's still loose pattern on the nail, it will gunk up on the brush and the nail and look super lumpy",reflection
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"So that's why I like to let it dry, then dust off the excess and apply a second coat of base.",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,And dip again,tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Don't worry if you have some bald spots like I do here, that's due to the base drying before it comes into contact with the powder and 2nd coat will totally cover it up.",description
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,On my accent nails I decided to use a gorgeous silvery glitter powder called sterling ,tool
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"and I followed the same steps as before, doing 2 coats of color.",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"After I have all of my color powder on, I'll next be dipping into clear powder to add a barrier to the color",early instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"so when it's time to file, I don't accidentally file off the color.",justification
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Then after that I'll be moving on to Step 3, which is seal and protect and applying a generous layer of that to each nail",subgoal
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"One of the biggest benefits to dip powder is that it dries incredibly fast, so you don't have to worry about accidentally smudging anything",background info
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Now you can go ahead and file and buff the nails,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"I used two different files, starting with a coarser 1 to remove the bulk.",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Then I switched to a finer grit file to smooth out the surface, and when you're done filling, you can go ahead and wash your hands with warm soapy water and dry them thoroughly",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Now we're going to add one more layer of the seal and protect, but before it dries, wipe it off with a lint free wipe",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,This is just going to remove any excess debris that might still be on the nail and get the nail ready for top coat.,jusitifcation
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Step FOUR is to apply a layer of the top coat in quick short strokes and try not to over manipulate it,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"The instructions for this kit say to let that dry, then go in with a second coat at the top, which I did do, ",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"but I wasn't super happy with the shine, so once that completely dried I did just pop on a layer of plain clear top coat to make it extra glossy",instruction (optional)
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Finish with the nourishing oil to rehydrate your skin and that's it,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Unlike a gel manicure, dip powder dries hard as a rock so your nails won't have any flexibility and will stay super strong.",background info
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"And when it's time to remove, follow the surface of the dip manicure to break the seal, then wrap it as you would to remove a gel manicure with an acetone soaked cotton ball",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,I actually made a huge mistake here and didn't file the dip powder nearly enough so the acetone didn't soak deep enough into the layers,reflection
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"And when I went to remove it, I made the incredibly amateur mistake of peeling it off and I actually tore a piece of my nail",reflection
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"Fortunately, it was just a corner and it was on my thumb so I was able to file.",description
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,Found the damaged area but please please please don't peel it off,tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,File down the powder as much as you can and soak it for at least 30 minutes,late instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications.xlsx,"And if you have an e-file that will probably work even better, it won't quite dissolve like gel wood, but it will become soft enough that it pulls off easily when you remove the cotton ball and foil",tip

jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,That's the majority of what we need,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,We're so far,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,I think I've spent about 6:00 or €7.00 on this,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"You're talking five or six dollars £5 in the UK, something like that",tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,So without further ado that needs to go in here.,early instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,Right there we go,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"As you can see, it takes a lot of packing",outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"Now the heavier the bow, the tighter it needs packing",background info
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"I'm packing this for anything up to 6070 pound bows, so it's well packed in there",description

jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,Now this one here.,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,Is I'm not sure whether.,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,It's at least two years old,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,It could be as much as four years old.,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,And I've recovered recovered it,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,Ohh at least three or four times,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,And now you can use whatever you like to cover it,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,I've used Hessian is the easiest,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,That's burlap in other places around the world,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,Or utisak if you're in Germany,tool (multiple)

jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"To show you guys what I mean just for today I'm going to use Hessian and I'm going to do the new one, so let's have a go at that first.",tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"Right there we go, there's one Hessian sack opened up to its full width now then.",instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"The best way to compress that while we're putting this on is to have it upside down now, as you can imagine, as soon as you turn that upside down, it could conceivably all come out",early instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"It's pretty obvious, so here's a little tip and I've tried both with and without some plain old kitchen cling film",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"You can actually wrap more or less the whole bucket in this stuff, and you could actually shoot it like that",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,I've used this stuff before,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,This is like the stuff they used for.,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,"It's the industrial stuff they use for wrapping pallets that works pretty good too, but if you're careful you can actually turn it on top of whatever cover you're using and tape it that way",tool

jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,And then just poke everything in.,instruction

jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,and you can see how this could be.,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,Just a little bit tricky.,description

jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,And my favorite is the big bag.,tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,Cover I've got one somewhere,side note

kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,i'll put a a link to it up on the screen,background info
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,but i'm simply going to hold that and then you're looking for a little bit,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,,
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,ok so now we have our terminal end double federal loan,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,we've got our cable loaded,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,the next step is to thread the snare lock on it,subgoal
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,today i'm using slim locks,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,now,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,every lock will thread a little bit differently especially if you're using cam locks,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,but what you want to do is you want to go back to the free end of the cable,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,and on this slim lock you want to put the free end of the cable through the hole the non locking hole and let me see if i can,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,,
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,,
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,i'm going to pull this all the way through so that,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,now i have this to the tab is facing the terminal end,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,i go back to my free end and then put it through,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness.xlsx,i like this,instruction
,,pull it through and you can see there is our snare,outcome
,,and now the next step is to put our vinyl tubing support collar on it,subgoal
,,and this is probably i don't know,tool
,,half an inch of vinyl tubing,tool
,,the exact diameter of the tubing is based on what diameter cable that you're using and also what diameter support wire that you're using,tool
,,but you're just going to slide that on the free end all the way down so that when you go to to set the snare,instruction
,,the next step is to put your swivel on and you just stick to the free end of the cable,instruction
,,i like this,instruction
,,slide that on down,instruction
,,normally i would have a smaller diameter washer with a smaller diameter hole and i would use a one sixteenth inch top button,tool
,,but i'm not the smartest guy,side note
,,now the way that works is is you can see see that cable is free to rotate inside the swivel,outcome
,,that's what allows it to swivel it,outcome
,,so at that point our snare is finished and,outcome
,,as you can see it's pretty simple,reflection
,,you know the the the thing is is when you're doing it yourself if you screw some cable up,tip
,,or if you don't have something exactly like you want it you can toss it out or or whatever,tip
,,cut it up and save the parts and redo it but you're in control of it not somebody else,tip

z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,guide on distributor replacement for Chevy V8 Vortec engines,goal
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,If you need more explanation I have a full length video version of this one that should provide all the information that you need,background info
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,The only thing I'd recommend that I don't cover in this video is making a mark on the distributor body as well as one on the intake manifold in order to reference it later when installing the new distributor without this mark they could potentially set a check engine light code P1345.,tip
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,In which you would need a scan tool in order to set the Cam crank correlation,tip
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,Otherwise everything else should be covered in this video,briefing

z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"Once the distributor CAP is removed, you will want to rotate the engine over the top dead center number one compression stroke",early instruction 
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"To do this, you'll want to remove the fan shroud, then manually turn the engine over until the timing mark on the balancer meets the timing mark on the timing cover with the timing marks lined up",early instruction 
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,If the distributor rotor is pointing at #1 spark plug wire then you know you have the engine in the correct position,early instruction 
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,If the rotor is pointing at #6 spark plug wire then you need to rotate the engine over and.,early instruction 
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,,
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,At that point you can go ahead and lift the distributor straight out of the engine.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"OK, looking at the new distributor, we'll notice a few marks that we want to get lined up before we install the distributor",instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"First off, we have this dimple here at the bottom of the distributor",instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,What you want to do is line that dimple up with the white painted line there.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"These marks tell us where to set the distributor before we install it, so this is the starting position of the distributor",description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,When you go to install it into the engine.,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"I took the liberty of making these two marks right here, so the purpose of these marks, this one is where our final position is",late instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,This is where our starting position is so.,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,Looking back here.,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,That's our final position,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"If the rotor button were installed, we'd be pointing right here our starting position as we know.",description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,Is with the that dimple and that line.,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,Lined up,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,so you can make a mark like that if you want,late instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"If you want to install the distributor with this rotor button already on, you can do that by making this mark",late instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,This will tell you where this needs to face and when it's completely installed.,justification
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,It should point there.,justification
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"OK, so we got all the marks lined up as we talked about and we're going to install the distributor",subgoal
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,Make sure that that flat spot.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,On the distributor is roughly parallel.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,With the back of the intake manifold.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"OK, we've got the distributor where we want it, so just going to put this clamp.",instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,On the body of the distributor.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,And then finger tighten this bolt.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,So you can see a few bumps with the starter,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,It it didn't quite want to drop down so I just wiggled the base and it dropped right down into the oil pump drive so no need to use the screwdriver to line anything up,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,That's going to waste a lot of time,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,It's much easier just to just to get this.,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"Just get that hold down right there, start it onto the base of the distributor, get the bolt run down just enough to hold it snug",late instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"Don't tighten it, just finger tight so that this clamp is snug to the distributor base and then bump the starter",late instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"Normally it'll just fall right down by itself, but but for some reason it didn't that time",description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,So I just wiggled the base right here and it dropped right down.,late instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,So we'll just barely tighten this bolt.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,May need to make some adjustments later.,reflection
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"OK guys, we're going to wrap this up",transition
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,One piece of advice I will give you is if your installed distributor does not look almost identical to this then don't start the truck because you'll have to reset the top dead center on #1 cylinder and you're probably going to get a check engine light,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,It really needs to be installed almost identical to what I have here,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,The rotor should point at the small triangle with the number 8 or towards.,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"That number one spark plug wire? What have you? If it's not pointing here and it's pointing back towards the firewall at #6 spark plug, then it's not going to start and needs to point towards number one",instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"If it's not exactly on number one, that's OK, but it has to be very very close",instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"If it looks like it's more than a couple degrees off, then you're going to have to start over from scratch or at least pull the distributor out and see if you're off",instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"Maybe a tooth or two, but if you line up all the marks like I showed you.",instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"You shouldn't have any problems getting it right on at least the first or second time, so after that, go ahead and get your distributor cap back on your wires",instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"Back in, place airbox back in place as well as the fan shroud and you should be good to go",instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"If it has the check engine light P 1345, then and you're sure your distributor is installed correctly, then you may just be off slightly and at which point",early instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,"If you can't get it manually adjusted, you may need to.",early instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,Have someone with a scan tool to set that for you,early instruction

9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,hello ladies and gentlemen ,greeting
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,today i'm working on a two thousand and twelve and a sonata,goal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,the issue we're having here is that the break lights do not work consistently,motivation
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,the third eye brake light and this one here has always worked but these side lights are not working consistently,motivation
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,so they have removed some of the bulbs in them in order to keep them from burning out,briefing
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,and i believe there's a short and we're going to try to find it,briefing
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,but first i'll show you that the lights are working,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,so we have all the lights working and and you can see that the running lights are actually working here,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i'm gonna go ahead and shut those off,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,nice to see that they're off baby,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,we hit the brakes so if you can see that just the third eye is lighting up,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,so i'm going to diagnose and test some of this wiring and i will let you know what i find,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,they put bulbs in and they burn out very quickly,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,and just recently i noticed my neighbor was driving around and brake lights haven't been working so i figured i would offer to help them out,motivation
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,ok so you can see that all three brake lights are currently working on,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,the issue was that they kept burning out,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,what i have done to correct this problem was instead of using the factory twenty three fifty seven light bulbs,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i went with the eleven fifty seven which burned at least thirty percent cooler than those twenty three fifty sevens,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,the alternative will be to go with led lights if these happen to burnout or get too hot,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,if you install led lights you will need a load equalizer with each light,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,most kits come with two load equalizers and two led bulbs,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,it'll run you about fifty dollars,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,so what i did here to fix my problem was it was actually quite simple,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,but it was just it took a while to find i was,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i came in to to the trunk,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,here you remove these felt pads,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i'll remove the ball but i'm not going to touch anything while there's power running to it,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,but you can see there bulb is on,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i'll go ahead and shut that off,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,,
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,you can see there that the socket it has been pretty hot,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,that's the only reason it'd be discolored that way,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,oh i took a the tools such as this with the power off,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,so you you can take that tool and you see all those little tabs in there,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,see all,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,mine is slightly sticking out well,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,those were recessed in almost like maybe it wasn't getting complete contact maybe it was getting too hot and eventually in,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,the metal was just pressed in there,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i've read that some people are having these bulbs actually cook in there melting into the socket,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,if that is the case you can purchase these at your local hardware store or parts store and you just have to cut into these three wires and splice in a new the harness like this here,instruction (optional)
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,so that's a pretty straightforward deal,side note
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,this here is now and eleven fifty seven,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,instead of a twenty three fifty seven,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,it is much cooler,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i can actually take it out right after it's been on for a little bit rather than the twenty three fifty seven,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i couldn't even touch it and it actually smelt like something was burning over here,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,but these prongs,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,they get hot enough,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,on those twenty three fifty sevens,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i've seen that they are melting in there completely just melting everything,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,it's definitely a fire hazard and it definitely needs to be addressed by a hyundai,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,but until they do so or until they have a recall i am going to kick it down to eleven fifty sevens,reflection
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,and hopefully this will fix the issue,reflection
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,i've tested some stuff,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,under the dash,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,there's a stop signal relay under there,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles.xlsx,it does not click if you test that,tip

-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,what up nerds machina hair,greeting
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,and today i'm going to make an iron throne phone charger,goal
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,with the second season of demo thrones right around the corner i really wanted to make something related to it so i ended up with this,motivation
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i'm gonna use this usb cable,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i know it's purple but it's what i had and i'll fix that up later and this fits my android phone,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i'll also use two packs of these plastic cocktail swords and some other materials i'll get to soon,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i began preparing the cocktail swords by cutting off this part of the handle so this is the difference,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,now i just gotta deal with the rest of them,transition
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,at first i bought a pack of three hundred swords which turned out to be way too little so i had to buy another pack,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,and i actually ended up using all the six hundred swords,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,all right i'll put those aside,transition
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,for now,transition
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i continue to make a basic shape of the throne out of some scrap mdf i had lying around,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i marked up the size of my phone first and then drew a back piece that would be a bit wider than that,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,then i marked the seat with the same width and the death i wanted,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,finally i cut out all the pieces with a bandsaw on the back of the seat and the sides of the throne,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,here are all the pieces i used both with glue and tiny nails to attach the pieces together,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,the back piece didn't meet the sides so it was a bit wobbly but i fixed that by gluing some angled brackets to the inside with some strong epoxy glue,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,now this is what i have and what it should look like,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,to create the actual shape of the throne,subgoal
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i'll use some thick foam that i can cut into smaller pieces that looked somewhat like the shape i wanted and then use hot glue to attach it,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,it looks kind of rough at this point,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,but i gradually built up on that with more foam on top,early instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i'll add a layer of thin grey foam which will even out all the surfaces,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i did it only at the back first because i have to adjust the placement of the cable which i'll show you in a second,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i'm beginning in the long process of gluing on swords on the back first because this will determine the distance from the back to where the phone charger should be placed,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,when the back was done my lines my phone up against it and drew a line at the front,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i measured the right distance and drilled the hole through from underneath for the cable,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i had to fix it up a bit with the file to get the right shape and now it goes through,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,also drilling a path at the back so the cable can lie smoothly against the table,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,as i had the position of the phone on the charger i could build up with foam around it,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,covering that up with a thin gray foam too,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,before i continued i made sure to cover up all the other surfaces as well in several places,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,on the throne it looks like the swords are bent and twisted around some edges so i used my heat gun to warm up the plastic and bend it to the shape i needed,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,and then i could just glue it on where it fits,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i just checked how the phone fits before i started adding swords to the seat and it fits nicely,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,while gluing on the swords i left the picture up that i could use as a reference while working just to make it easier for myself,tip
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,also if you're wondering well i am color coding the sections it simply because i found it easier to actually see the depth and the layers of the swords,tip
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,where to fill in and in which direction the swords were pointed,tip
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,it would have looked more chaotic with all the colors in one place,tip
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,well at least to me,side note
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,for the top crown of the throne i only needed the blades of the swords,description
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i kept the handles as i need those lighter,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,time to glue the blades around the edge,subgoal
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,by the way we're giving away the headphones that i've made recently so if you want to participate,side note
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,make sure to check the link below,side note
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i was getting really close to the end and i just had to cover the last two sections on the back side,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,now i could use those extra handles along the edge at the top and along the three ridges on the back,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,all right nice,filler
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,all the swords have been glued on,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,looks like a very fabulous and not so iron throne,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,also the swords in the corner are all thus left of those six hundred,description
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,and i used them to cover any holes that i thought were too large,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,before painting i had to spend some time removing blue threads from in between the swords,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,when it looked nice and clean it was ready for the next step,transition
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i used the regular spray paint for indoor and outdoor projects that could be used on plastic,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i coated the whole thing black first as this will bring out the right shades i need for the iron effect,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,it needed a couple of codes from different angles to get into all the nooks and crannies,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,it already looks a lot better in black for the next layer,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i'm going to use this acrylic silver paint to make their own,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,looked like it was made out of iron,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i tried the technique called dry brushing which basically means that your painting with close to no paint on the brush and justice lightly highlighting the correct parts of your object,background info
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,there's a lot of nice and detailed tutorials on dry brushing on youtube already so check that out if you're interested,background info
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i just slowly built up the iron color with several layers to not make it too bright in the wrong places,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i still wanted to keep a lot of the black as it creates the right shading effect just for comparison,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,here the right side is painted with the first layer of silver paint while the left is just a black base,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i probably could have left it with just the silver coats but i decided to use some bronze acrylic paint to create some extra depth,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i was very careful not used in much of this,description
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i added a few spots here and there,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,because too much would ruin the whole iron look,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,finally i could attach the cable to get it into the right position,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i connected it to my phone and pushed it in place,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i chose to use hot glue because despite that it might not be the strongest or most durable glue it wouldn't pour,tool 
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,found the sides of the charger and glue that to the phone,tool 
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,i let it dry plugged it in and it works,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,but i still wasn't a fan of that purple cable,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,so i decided to use the leftover spray to make it black,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,when that's dry it's actually done,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics.xlsx,it was a time consuming project but i definitely think it was worth it and it looks really badass on my desktop,reflection

ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,So let's head over to the garage,transition
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,ant to take a step by step note to achieve a great green screen on a budget.,goal
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,Hey folks Jordan here for cinecom.net and welcome to the channel that is all about creative filmmaking with premiere Pro and Basic Phillip equipment,greeting
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,We shoot all of our episodes in our Green Screen studio,side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"We've made a permanent setup, but for the purpose of this tutorial, we'll make a new setup and a more common environment",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"Most of us don't have access to expensive studio equipment, so that's why we're going to set-up a green screen.",motivation
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"In the garage, for most homes this is usually a dark place or it only has some small windows which we could easily tape off",description
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"The idea is to start from a blank page, which means a completely dark room ",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"setting up a green screen is rather simple, but lighting it is a different story",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"Later in this video you'll see that we have to create two lighting zones, which means we're going to need some space as well",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,Your talent has to take some distance from the green screen and the camera too,justification
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"So not only we need a dark room, but also the space.",justification
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,You put up everything which recommends to have at least 4 meters or about 13 feet from the wall to wall,briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,and this tutorial video you'll see that we'll be using all sorts of materials from the garage,briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"There are hundreds of ways to put up and light a green screen, so your situation might be a little different on what you have laying around at home",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,but it's important to follow the techniques shown so you can get similar results,briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,So we've got a room,tool
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,The next thing is the green screen itself,tool
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,Now this fabric is not something special.,tool
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"If you like, you can also get this at a local fabric store, but I would suggest to just get a real green screen as they are actually pretty cheap",tool (multiple)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"You can find fabrics for as low as 20 bucks or even 50 bucks for a whole set with stands and everything, but the way everything mentioned here is listed in the description below",tool

ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"In other words, make sure to tighten this screen",early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,This is best done by having two stands and one pole on top of that.,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,Then use some clamps to stretch and tighten the fabric,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"You can also craft a wooden frame and tighten your green screen in there, but it's less portable",instruction (optional)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"Basically, anything will do just as long as you can tighten the fabric",justification

ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,like you might have heard somewhere else,filler
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,It's important to light the fabric evenly over the whole surface,early instruction

ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"when light is diffused, it spreads better over the surface.",justification
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,Cheapest solution is to hang a white cloth and each science and place your lights behind it,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,I have attached two work lights to each site so that I both illuminate the top and the bottom of the screen,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,This technique will work with any kinds of lights,tool (multiple)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,If you have some light bulbs laying around or like to craft something of your own it will work perfectly,tool (multiple)

ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,"Once you've got that out of the way, we can focus on the subject, ",description

VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,how do you start painting murals and want to start from a beginner's perspective,goal

VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,so what are some of your options,transition
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,i went to college in the boston area massachusetts really near talem beverly and in beverly there is this legal wall,reflection

VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,for beginners this is really a great way to go ,tip
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,once you build up some sort of base of portfolio this is how we really when the momentum when you start to snowball effects happens,instruction
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,because you can start pitching projects to people,effect
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,for example i pitched a project to an organization in sri lanka,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,so really quite a long story,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,but in the end i was able to go around sri lanka and paint in local schools and do relatively large scale,reflection

VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,and then there was an event where a group of guys were able to get a building that they were going to tear down,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,the piece that i did there became really popular in the city and the next year i was asked by the same group of guys and they had one spot for an artist to go on a lift and do a piece,reflection

VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,yeah of course,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,i've been waiting past three years to to to get on a lift which for me was really deciding factor because on a lift you're really quite close to the wall and you have to really get all the way down to look back at your art,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,so got the opportunity,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment.xlsx,i hustled,reflection

,,first off is if you are playing chords along with a singer or something like that and you're playing along and they say,subgoal
,,a little bit more so it's a little bit instead of having and then you could bring it up a couple of frets and it's just a little bit brighter,description
,,so that's one of the reasons that a lot of flamenco players will use this as well,justification
,,i don't know if that's a reason that flamingo players do it or not but it's a benefit because it just makes the instrument a little bit easier to get around on right here,justification
,,so that's the second reason,transition
,,a third reason is that a composer you piece of classical guitar music or something a composer may use this for a particular reason,subgoal
