2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"Hey, what's up everybody I'm Tommy",greeting
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,and today I'm going to show you how I made this vice mounted router table with built in dust collection,goal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"Whether it's your first time here or even if you've been here before, welcome to one Minute Workbench.",greeting
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"So when I started out building this router table, I actually intended on it just being a temporary jig, but during the building process it sort of evolved into this fully featured router table",briefing
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I started off by cutting a piece for the mounting block and a piece for the main surface of the router table.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I checked to see that the router would have plenty of room and make sure that the device would not interfere with its operation,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,Then I secured the two pieces together.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"Everywhere I used screws, I made sure to drill pilot holes and counter sinks.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I chose a bit that was larger than my largest router, bit marked a hole in the center of the table, and then drilled it out on the drill press.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I lowered the bit into the hole to help me align the router to the approximate center with the router and the approximate center,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I marked the mounting thread locations with a pencil.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I picked a forstner bit large enough to accommodate the tool for the bolt heads, and then drill the holes.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I finished drilling the holes with a 5 sixteenths inch bit to match the size of the mounting bolts.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I realized though that the mounting holes on the router were not symmetric, so I had to do it again",description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,Starting from the bottom of the table.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I mounted the router in place, set the bit depth for a roundover and gave it a preliminary test.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"It was all looking good, so I decided to make a fence.",subgoal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"At first I just clamped the fence in place to test it since that was working well, I figured I might as well continue and make it adjustable.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I just copied the cut out from the fence to the fence base.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"Now I'm doing these cuts with a bandsaw, but you could easily do these with a jigsaw or a coping saw.",tool (multiple)
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"With the fence built, I started working on the adjustment knobs.",subgoal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I rounded all of the corners using my homemade disc Sander.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"Since I had the Sander out, I took the opportunity to go ahead and round over all the other sharp corners.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I glued up the knobs and then set those aside to dry.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"While the knobs were drying, I took some measurements and determined where I wanted the mounting bolts for the adjustable fence.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I added mounting bolts, but I'm not going to go into detail on this because as you'll see in just a bit I ended up changing this feature.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I needed to add slots so I scored a line and then drilled 1/2 inch hole in the center of that line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"With a half inch bit installed in the router, I use the hole to install a temporary fence for cutting the slots.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"Right when I finished making the knobs, I realized I wanted to change things so that the bolts were part of the knobs and not part of the table",subgoal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,So I removed the bolts and drilled out large counter bores in the mounting block,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,This allowed me to use T nuts and the mounting block.,effect
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"To make the new knobs, I drilled 1/2 inch counter bore and A5 sixteenths inch through hole in the main component and then drill to 5/8 inch hole in a smaller bottom component",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,This will make sense in just a little bit.,transition
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,The hole in the knob is intentionally left a little bit smaller than the points of the hex bolt,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,This lets you hammer the bolt in place and lets the wood form a nice snug fit.,effect
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"To make sure the bolt didn't back out, I used a nylon lock nut.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I of course rounded all the corners and then added the bottom components to the knobs.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I scored a center line on a small scrap and then transferred the center line all the way around the ends.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,Then I used a pencil just to darken the center line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I very carefully drilled 1/2 inch hole in the center of that line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I mounted the router in place, inserted the bit into the piece and squared the piece with the outside edge of the table",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,Then I made marks to match the center line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I carefully transfer the center line to the table itself,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,This gave me a mark that is aligned with the center of the bit.,effect
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"To test out the mark, I used a very accurate ruler to set the depth of the fence to three inches",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I made a test cut and then measured it with a half inch bit,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,The measurement to the inside edge should be 2.75 inches,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"It looked really close, so I measured it with a caliper.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"As you can see here, it's within 2007 inch which is really close with the success of the first few cuts I decided to build the rulers right into the table.",description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,These steel rulers were just a dollar each at harbor freight,tool
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I took some basic measurements and cut them down to size using a pair of tin snips.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,Then I use the rulers themselves as a guide for drawing the marks,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I would need to embed them in the table.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I carefully aligned a scrap of wood and clamped it in place so it could work as a guide for my router.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I set the router's bit so that it would cut a slot just a little bit deeper than the thickness of the ruler.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I then repeated the process for the other side.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I added hot glue to the slot and set the ruler in place,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,Unfortunately I was moving kind of slow here and the glue actually set-up before I could get the ruler pressed all the way down,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,So I used a heat gun to soften the glue so I could push the ruler down until it was flush with the table.,tip
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I thought it would be quicker on the second one, but I wasn't and wound up having to use the heat gun again.",tip
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,The heat gun did the trick and the rulers were perfectly flush with the table top.,outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I removed the excess glue from the rulers with a little bit of Windex.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I added the router back in place and used the alignment block to make sure the router was perfectly centered with the line.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,My first Test cut was at 2 inches and with a half inch bit,outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"When measured to the first edge should be 1.75 inches and as you can see here, the result was within 5 thousandths of an inch, which is very good.",outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"With the accuracy on point, I turned my attention to creating dust collection dust collection around the router itself is the trickiest part, so I started with that for this first cut",subgoal
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I was able to trace the outline of the router and cut it out on the bandsaw with a little bit of back and forth,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I was able to get a nice fit.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I then worked on the upright walls of the box, which I just had to eyeball and make some test cuts on again",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,With a little bit of back and forth,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,It was done in just a few minutes.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"The rest of the box was just small square pieces, so I cut those out and started assembling it.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I traced out the top of the box and trimmed it to match the rest of the pieces.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I changed my mind about the side I wanted the vacuum on,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,So I plugged the original vacuum hole.,instructional (optional)
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I cut a few small blocks that would allow a threaded knob to hold the box in place.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I then added a tee nut that would accept the threaded knob.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I marked the threaded rod with a Sharpie so I could see where to trim it and then trimmed it with a hacksaw.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"And for safety, I filed the sharp edges until they were smooth.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I added some foam to the edges of the box where it contoured to the shape of the router.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I then added a small wooden block and used some hot glue to attach a foam block that would cover the last remaining opening.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,These small guide blocks will just make it easier to properly align the box.,justification
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,The bottom dust collection box allows the router to be lowered and raised while the box is in place.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"With the bottom dust collection box and the vacuum line in place, I made a test cut",outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"It didn't collect all the dust, but I would say it got about 75%.",outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,The threaded knob allows me to quickly remove and replace the box when I need to change router bits.,outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,The top dust collection box was a lot easier than the bottom one,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"I just glued it, clamped it in place and let it dry for about an hour.",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,This top dust collection box is perfect for round overs and pretty much collects 100% of the dust.,description
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"With everything working good, I took it all apart and prepped it for finishing for finishing",instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I applied 6 coats of satin water based polyurethane and sanded in between coats.,instruction
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,I'm really happy with how the router table turned out,outcome
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"As I mentioned before, it was just going to be a temporary jig, but I'm happy that I took the time to go ahead and build some more features into it.",reflection
2Xyfgwj92v0,Home and Garden,"Hey, thanks for watching",outro

mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,hello,greeting
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,do it yourselfers,greeting
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,i'm terry peterman the internet electrician,greeting
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,welcome to another one of my video shorts on current topics,greeting
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,let's get started all right,transition
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,in this short video we're going to troubleshoot a desk lamp here,goal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,when we arrived at our place here in costa rica this lamp worked just fine,motivation
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so what went wrong,motivation
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,well first of course the most obvious thing is to check is the light bulb and and i changed the bulb and still no functiona on this one,late instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so let's try and swap it with one that we absolutely know works,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,is you never know when you get a bad bulb,jusitification
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so we'll switch the one out of the bad lamp,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,put it in the one we know it works and it does it,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,and and the one we know was working,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,still nothing,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so we're plugged into the same outlet,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,i guess you can always try that because sometimes and this is actually a good tip,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,lots of times in homes you're going to find that half of the outlets are switched and half as hot all the time,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,half is on a wall switch,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so just to make sure that's not the case here which i know it isn't,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,but what you want to do is swap them then you're sure,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so we've swapped the lamps and that one still works and not outlet,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,and this one doesn't,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so what we've got to do is take this lamp apart find out what went wrong,subgoal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so one thing you want to do is examine the socket inside of the the lamp here,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,now you can see this point right in there that makes contact with the center of the bulb,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,that's your heart and this is your neutral that touches the shell of the light bulb itself,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,one thing i notice here i don't see any burnt points like lots of times,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,you'll find that rivet down here on the on,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,the center pin is corroded so that can cause you problems,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,that's one thing to check,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,the center pin should also have some spring to it not be all soft and malleable but this is good,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,it's spring steel and here make sure that there's no corrosion on what makes contact with the shell of the bulb for the neutral,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,all that seems good in this one but i did notice the socket is loose,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so if you look right down in here there's a phillips and a standard blade screw head machine screw head that's loose,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so we're just gonna tighten that up a little and that makes the socket nice and tight in there,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,we'll bend it back to the center position so that's not the problem,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,we're going to take the base off this lamp and see if something went wrong with the switch,subgoal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so again with the lamp unplugged,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,as you can see there's three screw holes here that just hold this plastic base on,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,remove those i've got them all loosened up,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,take the base off and have a look and right away i see what the problem is,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,i let me bring you in for a close up of this,transition
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so here's the rocker switch that turns this lamp on and off,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,you'll notice on the other one it's an inline lamp cord switch that operates it,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,but this one's got a a switch on the base,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,well as soon as i pulled that base off you can see what the problem is,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,this is just a simple single pole switch single pole rocker switch and this brown wire was popped right off of a terminal of the switch,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,soul,filler
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,the neutral is carried right on through to the lamp socket and it's fine but we got to resolder that wire on to that,early instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,there you go to that little terminal right there,early instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,and once we do that i'm sure this lamp will work,effect
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so i just need to add a little bit of solder to these connections,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so i've got my iron nice and hot here,tool
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,now you'll see,transition
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,i'm just going to touch the solder to the tip make sure that it's hot enough to melt,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,solder and it is,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so there's probably some residual solder left on the terminal but i'll add a little bit anyway,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so what you want to do is touch your iron down to the wire and the terminal and they need to to both get hot enough to,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,you'll see the sodder flow into the terminal when things are hard enough and i'll touch up to the other terminal as well,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,too much there,description
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,you don't want too much solder just enough to i just enough to flow into the wire and the terminal,tip
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,there i saw it,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,i saw it flow into the terminal,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,i think that's about as close as i can get that shot blow on it cool it off a little bit,instruction
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,and i see that switch is a little bit loose in there but i have a good solder job between the wire and the terminal,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so now that i've got my soldering complete you can see it's all nice and tight on that terminal,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,and that one's good,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,now before i put the base on i'm just going to test the lamp and make sure it works,subgoal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,and then we'll put it all back together,subgoal
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,so i haven't put the bass back on yet just in case there's still something wrong,jusitification
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,but let's test our lamp out and it works as it should be and the other one's working so we can put that bass back on,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,and we've saved ourselves a few bucks,outcome
mwpb65gm1e0,Home and Garden,it's not an expensive lamp but in this day and age of throwaway society you can see just how simple it can be to repair something like this instead of tossing it out,reflection

oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,welcome to specific love today,greeting
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,i'm gonna show you how i built this awesomely simple air filtration system that will do great at removing dust from your workshop or your garage,goal
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,let's begin now if you ask about any woodworker what is one of the major issues you have in the shop,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,that would be dust collection,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,dust gets everywhere it's in just in the air,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,when you're especially if you're using the table saw or miter saw which is really hard,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,even with a good dust collection system it's very hard to even get it to collect even most of the dust,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now i've used a simple four billion that i've tried to have it just a basic filter on to see if that would help,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,and it just crap gets stuck all in this filter,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,and i don't believe the fan is working at top efficiency,motivation
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so trying to help solve that problem i found this huge four by filter which should give a lot more surface area and a lot more ability for this simple little fan to pull it through,tool
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,hopefully in the sense cleaning out a lot more of the air and getting rid of a lot of that dust,tool
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now to do that i'm going to build a box around this filter and this fan try and house everything just in one type area,subgoal
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so i first started ripping some two by fours down into some one and a half inch strips,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,this will allow the frame to be strong and relatively light,effect
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,plus i can keep the wood needed to a minimum and if you look here you should also be able to see all of the dust floating in the air just from cutting a simple board,justification
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,,description
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,and then measured the fan and filter and cut the wood into the needed lanks,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,a quick test fit showed that the cuts were acceptable and,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now it did drill pilot holes for all of the screws to help avoid splitting which can be common in pine lumber,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,i then completed the second frame for the other side,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,to connect the frames i added two more wood strips to the bottom and two to the top,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so be careful when you're trying to rip me two by fours,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so be very careful whenever you're using a table,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,saw that real dangerous things can't happen so always be as safe as possible,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,once the frame was secure i grabbed the fans and filter for a test fit and they slid in well,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now to give the structure more strength and keep the fan and filter from falling out it needed a floor and back wall,justification
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,if you have not seen that funny video i will put a link in the description i think,side note
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,cut out the floor and secured in place with a few screws,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so i cut down some more plywood and attach the top and the back with several more screws,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now to keep the fan and filter from falling out of the sides of the frame during transport or getting bumped,justification
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,i added a sidebar on both sides,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,she doesn't agree but she doesn't want to tell you you're wrong,side note
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,yeah one of those,side note
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so i asked well what color would you paint it and she said how about brown,side note
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now i did discover something that actually pretty cool about first painting this orange and then painting it brown,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,it may be hard to tell in the video but it turned out almost a cherry type color which is really cool hack,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so if you ever need to make a cherry tight color and all you have and the have is orange and brown,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,do a nice thick layer of orange and then just a light coating of brown and it should come out pretty cool,tip
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now to help with the filtration i wanted a way to help prevent the large particles from reaching a filter,justification
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so i grabbed some old window screen,tool
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,waved it around the side support and stapled it to the inside of the frame to keep the exterior looking uniform,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now to keep the fan and filter from falling out of the front of the frame i decided to add a small bungee cord,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so i've tapped in a couple nails in the back sides of the front supports and the cord could be attached or removed easily,instruction
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,yeah yeah,filler
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,now that we know this works we have easy access to change the filters,outcome
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,and it's pretty lightweight because it is just simple two by fours that i have cut down into one and a half inch strips,outcome
oe7Cz-dxSBY,Home and Garden,so if you have a great idea of where to put this where the hang this or where ever you think i should do it,outro

ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"Exactly, you're cleaning on your sneaker, but I'll definitely be sure to mention what tool is specifically needed for certain sections on your shoe",transition
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So first up, you're gonna definitely need a bowl of water",tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,It doesn't matter what temperature it is next,tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,You're going to need your brushes,tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So I've got this magic Racer sponge, which is really great to clean your midsole now if your midsole has any kind of texture to it, you may actually need a toothbrush to really get in there and lift off that dirt",tool (multiple)
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"Next, you're going to need a standard synthetic shoe brush like I've got.",tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"Here by Jason Mark, this is going to clean the upper of your sneaker",tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"But if you are working with premium Leathers or woven materials, you actually want to go with a boar bristle brush which will be a lot softer",tool (multiple)
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So I'll definitely link all of my favorite products to use when cleaning your shoes in my article, which I'll link below for the cleaning solution, you can either go with an eco friendly all natural dish soap you just put a little bit in some water",tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Make sure though the most important thing is that it should say on the bottle that it it is fragrance free.,tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Dye free and non-toxic,tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"This is going to ensure that it doesn't cause any yellowing on your shoes, so I personally like using Jason Marks cleaning solution",justification
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,I just find it to be more effective than the dish soap and the,tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,last thing that you need is going to be a microfiber towel,tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,This is just to wipe down your shoe at the very end,tool
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,That's it,filler
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,So now let's get into how exactly you should clean your sneakers,transition
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So first, if it's just the midsoles of your sneakers that need to be clean, then all you need is just a magic.",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"Eraser dip the sponge in a bowl of water, squeeze to remove any excess water, and then you're going to just rub the sponge on the midsole to remove all of that dirt",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"As you can see, it's really working.",description
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"There is this part in the back where the dirt is just not lifting off, and it's because I have a textured midsole",description
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So in order to really lift the dirt out, I'm going to just use a toothbrush and take my Jason Markk solution and just put it on the toothbrush, shake it out, and then I'm going to start scrubbing to really get that dirt out of there",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"It's going to lather up like very nicely, which you want",description
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,You just kind of vigorously scrub.,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"OK, so I scrubbed it pretty thoroughly all around and now I'm just going to take my microfiber towel and just wipe my midsole and look at that",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,It is so much wider it really lifted that dirt off,outcome
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"If your sneaker needs a deeper clean, then we got to go a little bit further than that, so let's get into how to completely clean the entire sneaker",subgoal
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"First off, what you want to do is take your microfiber towel and just wipe the surface of your sneaker",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,This is going to remove.,effect
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Any kind of loose dirt that is sitting on the top of the fabric,effect
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Now what you want to do is if your shoelaces need to be cleaned,subgoal
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"If they seem really dirty and your tongue is really dirty, you just want to unlace your shoe and then throw the laces into the washer with a load of whites on the hot cycle you want hot water to wash your laces, and that's going to get them nice and clean",early instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So let's get started by getting your brush ready, dip it in some water, shake off the excess",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Then you're going to take your Jason Markk solution.,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,And pretty much douse the brush,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Be really generous with the amount of liquid you put on and then dip the brush back in and just shake off the excess,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,And now we're ready to completely scrub the shoe,subgoal
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"I always like to put my hand inside the shoe just to be able to hold it,",tip
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,and then I'm really just going to scrub the shoe,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"You want a nice lather like this? See, my tongue is very dirty.",description
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So as I'm rushing the upper, I'm also still just going to scrub the midsole, get the entire area of the sneaker.",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So sometimes you have hard to reach areas like this piece in the tongue, so I'll use this toothbrush to really get in there and just scrub it",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Same over on this side,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"So now what we want to do is wipe it completely down so we'll take our microfiber towel and I'm just going to wipe away all of that foam to see if there's any areas that still need to be brushed and just a quick note, if you are dealing with a woman upper like these fly knits, then after you scrubbed the upper what you want to do is take a microfiber.",instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Towel and just dab and twist so that it will remove any excess moisture on the woven upper,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,And then you'll let it air dry,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,But you don't want to wipe it down,instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,because that can potentially cause fraying and nappiness to your woven material,justification
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,So I've wiped these down,outcome
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"I'm going to just inspect the entire sneaker to make sure that there are no dirt spots that I still want to scrub out, but I am very happy with this",outcome
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,I love how this turned out,side note
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"Next, we're going to let them air dry and then once they're dry, I'm going to lace them back up with my clean laces. ",early instruction
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,So these are fresh out of the washer,outcome
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,There's so much wider than The Dirty ones that we started off with,outcome
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,"Alright, so this is how your sneakers should look after you spend about 5-10 minutes cleaning them",outcome
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,They look now pretty much brand new and really fresh and great,outcome
ntYwKXN82QU,Personal Care and Style,Do this about every one to two weeks depending on how dirty your sneakers get and that'll ensure your sneakers looking brand new every single time,tip

dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Hey guys, it's Sandy",greeting
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Welcome back to cute Polish,greeting
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,In today's video we're going to be talking about dip powder,goal
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Nails dip powder has been all the rage this year, but the application of it can sometimes get tricky",motivation
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,so Julie will be sharing her tips and tricks today on how to perfect your dip powder manicure at home,goal
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Hey, it's Julie now let's get started with the video",transition
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"First things first, you're going to need a dip powder kit",tool
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"There are a lot of options right now, but for this video I'll be using the Kira sky.",tool (multiple)
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Kid, because it comes with everything you need and it's packaged and easy steps one through 5 bottles ",justification
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,as you would with any manicure you're going to want to start with cleaned groomed nails,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,This means push your cuticles back,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,File your nails into shape and remove any residue from the nail plate.,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"This particular kit comes with step by step instructions for how to use the dip powder, which I do follow, but I have learned a couple things that weren't mentioned in the instructions, which I will share with you a little later",tool
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,The first step is to apply a thin layer of bonder,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"This is basically just a dehydrator and it's going to remove the excess oils from your nails to make sure the dip powder adheres properly, but don't panic",effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,This is supposed to leave your nails looking pale and really dried out,effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Step 2 is to apply the base.,subgoal
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Polish to 3/4 of your nail, then quickly dip it into the natural colored dip powder",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,This is going to help disguise any visible nail line you have and make the final color more opaque and even,effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"It doesn't say this in the instructions, but you have to work one nail at a time because the base dries fairly quickly and you need to get that powder on while it's still wet, or else it will not stick at all",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Another thing I don't think the instructions clearly state is to dip your finger in at about a 45 degree angle until it's completely submerged in the powder and then pull it out.,tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Tap off the excess powder and let it dry while you move on to the next nails,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Tapping your finger will remove the majority of the loose powder, but there might be quite a bit still stuck to your nail",effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"So what I like to do is, once the base and first layer of powder are dry, maybe about two or three minutes, I'll take a big kabuki brush and dust off the excess",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,This will keep the layers thin and keep product from building up on your brushes,effect
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Now you can grab the colored dip powder,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"I'll be using this deep red shade that's funnily named hot chocolate, and just like before.",tool
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Apply the base, but this time you can apply it to your entire nail and then dip it into the colored powder",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Word of caution, these powders are extremely pigmented, so you're going to get some color on your skin, but it will wash off later with soap.",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"If you see any spots you might have accidentally missed, it's OK to add a little more of the base than dip it again",instruction (optional)
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Here's where I ran into problems when I first did this,reflection
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"If you applied the base over top of your first coat of color and there's still loose pattern on the nail, it will gunk up on the brush and the nail and look super lumpy",reflection
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"So that's why I like to let it dry, then dust off the excess and apply a second coat of base.",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,And dip again,tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Don't worry if you have some bald spots like I do here, that's due to the base drying before it comes into contact with the powder and 2nd coat will totally cover it up.",description
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,On my accent nails I decided to use a gorgeous silvery glitter powder called sterling ,tool
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"and I followed the same steps as before, doing 2 coats of color.",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"After I have all of my color powder on, I'll next be dipping into clear powder to add a barrier to the color",early instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"so when it's time to file, I don't accidentally file off the color.",justification
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Then after that I'll be moving on to Step 3, which is seal and protect and applying a generous layer of that to each nail",subgoal
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"One of the biggest benefits to dip powder is that it dries incredibly fast, so you don't have to worry about accidentally smudging anything",background info
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Now you can go ahead and file and buff the nails,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"I used two different files, starting with a coarser 1 to remove the bulk.",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Then I switched to a finer grit file to smooth out the surface, and when you're done filling, you can go ahead and wash your hands with warm soapy water and dry them thoroughly",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Now we're going to add one more layer of the seal and protect, but before it dries, wipe it off with a lint free wipe",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,This is just going to remove any excess debris that might still be on the nail and get the nail ready for top coat.,jusitifcation
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Step FOUR is to apply a layer of the top coat in quick short strokes and try not to over manipulate it,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"The instructions for this kit say to let that dry, then go in with a second coat at the top, which I did do, ",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"but I wasn't super happy with the shine, so once that completely dried I did just pop on a layer of plain clear top coat to make it extra glossy",instruction (optional)
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Finish with the nourishing oil to rehydrate your skin and that's it,instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Unlike a gel manicure, dip powder dries hard as a rock so your nails won't have any flexibility and will stay super strong.",background info
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"And when it's time to remove, follow the surface of the dip manicure to break the seal, then wrap it as you would to remove a gel manicure with an acetone soaked cotton ball",instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,I actually made a huge mistake here and didn't file the dip powder nearly enough so the acetone didn't soak deep enough into the layers,reflection
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"And when I went to remove it, I made the incredibly amateur mistake of peeling it off and I actually tore a piece of my nail",reflection
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"Fortunately, it was just a corner and it was on my thumb so I was able to file.",description
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,Found the damaged area but please please please don't peel it off,tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,File down the powder as much as you can and soak it for at least 30 minutes,late instruction
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"And if you have an e-file that will probably work even better, it won't quite dissolve like gel wood, but it will become soft enough that it pulls off easily when you remove the cotton ball and foil",tip
dJ_qCDWNvXU,Education and Communications,"If you guys have any tips you'd like to share, go ahead and leave them in the comments below, and if you'd like to watch more helpful cute Polish videos, you can click on these boxes here and you can click on the circle to subscribe to cute Polish.",outro

jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Today, for the very first DIY series from Robert and Archery, ",greeting
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,we're gonna be making one of these.,goal
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"That is, a builders bucket target.",goal
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,So let's get started,transition
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"First of all, we need to get in one of these.",side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,And then we need to go to one of these.,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Now we need to buy one of these.,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Michael.,filler
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"So we've got our builders bucket, what we're going to need next.",transition
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Is some of this?,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Actually, quite a lot of this.",tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,So we've got our main constituents of our bucket target,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,We've got the bucket and we've got the filling,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Believe it or not.,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,That's the majority of what we need,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,We're so far,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I think I've spent about 6:00 or €7.00 on this,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"You're talking five or six dollars £5 in the UK, something like that",tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,So without further ado that needs to go in here.,early instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Right there we go,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"As you can see, it takes a lot of packing",outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Now the heavier the bow, the tighter it needs packing",background info
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"I'm packing this for anything up to 6070 pound bows, so it's well packed in there",description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Let me show you what I'm replacing the cover on.,transition
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Now this one here.,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Is I'm not sure whether.,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,It's at least two years old,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,It could be as much as four years old.,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,And I've recovered recovered it,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Ohh at least three or four times,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,And now you can use whatever you like to cover it,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I've used Hessian is the easiest,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,That's burlap in other places around the world,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Or utisak if you're in Germany,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"I've used what else have I used? I've used felt backed carpet, which works really surprisingly well.",tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,One of my favourites is this stuff.,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,The big bags that you get about a ton of gravel in.,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,You get companies who just.,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Throw that away,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,They don't want him anymore because they might be ripped away,tool (multiple)
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,They just cut out the bits you want,instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Hey Presto, you've got to cover a cover for your target.",outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,So basically all you need to do now is cover it,subgoal
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Put some tape around to hold the cover in and you've got a workable target now.,subgoal
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"To show you guys what I mean just for today I'm going to use Hessian and I'm going to do the new one, so let's have a go at that first.",tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Right there we go, there's one Hessian sack opened up to its full width now then.",instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"The best way to compress that while we're putting this on is to have it upside down now, as you can imagine, as soon as you turn that upside down, it could conceivably all come out",early instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"It's pretty obvious, so here's a little tip and I've tried both with and without some plain old kitchen cling film",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"You can actually wrap more or less the whole bucket in this stuff, and you could actually shoot it like that",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I've used this stuff before,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,This is like the stuff they used for.,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"It's the industrial stuff they use for wrapping pallets that works pretty good too, but if you're careful you can actually turn it on top of whatever cover you're using and tape it that way",tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"That's what we're going to do today, and I'll zoom the camera in so you can see what I'm doing.",transition
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Right, what I'm going to do is just cover this with the Hessian first of all.",instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Keep it reasonably tight and then just.,instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Tip it upside down like this.,instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,And then just poke everything in.,instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,As much as I can Around the edges,instruction
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,and you can see how this could be.,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Just a little bit tricky.,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Now the tape I'm going to use today is just plain packaging tape.,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I'm not sure how this is gonna work,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"I usually usually use duct tape or something similar, but let's see how it goes.",side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Right?,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,And there we go.,outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Up basically.,outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Is our finished target.,outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,You can actually shoot on that.,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,So there we go,outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Not only have we got.,outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"A very robust target which will last for a long, long time",outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Yeah, you'd need to replace the face from time to time,",reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,but don't you on all targets.,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,But check this out.,transition
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,It's that easy to withdraw the arrows now.,outcome
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Hessian couple of little tips for you with Hessian,tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"It can rot if it stays wet for too long, so this is probably the least robust option",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"The next favorite for me would be felt backed carpet that tends to last a fair while slightly harder to withdraw the arrows, but still pretty good",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,And my favorite is the big bag.,tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Cover I've got one somewhere,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Just hold on there.,transition
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"So yeah, this is an old.",description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Big bag cover that I've just split to take off,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,You can see how it's shot out in the middle,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,That one was probably I don't know,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"A year old, maybe longer and you can see they're more robust tape",description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I've used on my own so that's just to show you guys,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I'm probably going to take this back off and get some decent tape,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,What else can I tell you about these things?,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Some of the instructionals use clothes cloth.,background info
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Kind of wool.,background info
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Industrial wall type stuff and there's nothing wrong with that,background info
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,It stops arrows brilliantly,background info
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,They even use it for crossbows,background info
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I'm pretty sure this would stop a crossbow too.,background info
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"I tried it on two or three targets, and.",reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I'll tell you the problem.,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Number one it gets wet.,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Number two, when it gets wet, it gets very heavy #3 when it gets wet and heavy it starts to stink",reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,There you go moldy and getting rid of the clothes,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,For me at least here in Germany was a pain in the backside,reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"OK with the plastic, it's waterproof",reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"It stays light, you can leave it out all year round",reflection
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"It's not an issue, so my advice would be use the plastic, put some kind of robust cover on it, like the big bag or tarpaulin material even.",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Experiment with it and you've got a target there which.,tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Yes, is worth.",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I don't know a hell of a lot more than the five or €6.00 that I paid for this.,tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Be careful of rolling, yes, they've got handles on sometimes",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,I choke it,tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,It depends what ground you're on,tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"If it's flat, not a worry and the plastic for these stuff, they're not a rubber",tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"This is plastic, but it's a very",tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,It's a very elastic plastic,tool
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Again, let me show you one that's been used.",transition
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"OK, now I don't know if you can make out on this.",side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,You can see here.,transition
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,If I can catch the light you can see here where I have had arrows penetrate where they've gone along the side of the packing,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"OK, so make sure the packing is as tight into the side of the bucket as you can, but you can see it doesn't split",late instruction 
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,It doesn't shatter the plastic,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,You can actually kind of just peel that off so.,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,That's the kind of material you're looking for,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"Now if you take that technique and here's a bonus for you, it's very easy.",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,"To take a uto sack, Hessian sack, burlap sack, whatever you want to call it and do exactly the same thing",tip
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Now this one is one that has been.,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Shot out there we go,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,You can see how I've kind of tacked it together with cable size or zip ties,description
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,Whatever you want to call them,side note
jGsEBwiKnCI,Sports and Fitness,And the center was shot out.,description

kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,trepper here today,greeting
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i'm going to give you a quick tutorial on how i build a beaver snare from beginning to end,goal
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i buy all of my snare supplies from southern snares dot com and i would urge you to do the same,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,so give brian mckee a call,side note
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,southern snares dot com,side note
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,tell him what you want or if you don't know what you want just call them and tell them what you want to catch and he'll take care of you,side note
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,so let's get started,transition
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,the first thing that we have is our snare cable,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,this is a four foot piece of one sixteenth inch cable one by nineteen twist and as you can see,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,it has been dipped in formula one's giving a giving it a slight brown color,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,so we have our snare cable,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,as far as tools we need cable cutters to cut our piece of cable we're going to need a good solid hammer to hammer our parts on,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,and we'll need a pair of good american made needle nose pliers,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,as far as parts we're going to use double ferrals and this is one sixteenth inch double ferrals,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,we're going to need our snare lock and you can see these locks,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i'm using slim locks today and these have also been dipped in formula one,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,we have our vinyl tubing snare supports cut to,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i don't know half an inch or something like that,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,we have our swivels and today i'm using a nine gauge heavy duty swivels,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,we need our swivel washers which are just little washers like this,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,and we have stop buttons,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,and i'm using the three thirty second inch stop buttons,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,and i'll explain why,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,when we get to the portion where we put that on,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,so let's get started,transition
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,step number one is to take one end of our cable and we're going to take a double ferrell,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,we're going to slide it on the end of the cable and what we want to do is,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,so what i'm going to do is i'm going to use my needle nose pliers to bend that over and then i'm going to hold it with the pliers and then insert it,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,ok so now we're going to hammer this shut,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,so when you try it you'll see but start with your i see if i can get that palm up and then i see that's a natural roll over on that table,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,and then i'm going to,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i put a little memory in it and work and work at once or twice and ,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,what you want to end up with it is something that looks kind of like that,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,now the next thing is to load the cable,subgoal
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i use just a nail on the side of this and like i say for details on how to load cable,description
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,watch my other video on it,background info
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i'll put a a link to it up on the screen,background info
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,but i'm simply going to hold that and then you're looking for a little bit,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,ok so now we have our terminal end double federal loan,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,we've got our cable loaded,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,the next step is to thread the snare lock on it,subgoal
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,today i'm using slim locks,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,now,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,every lock will thread a little bit differently especially if you're using cam locks,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,but what you want to do is you want to go back to the free end of the cable,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,and on this slim lock you want to put the free end of the cable through the hole the non locking hole and let me see if i can,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i'm going to pull this all the way through so that,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,now i have this to the tab is facing the terminal end,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i go back to my free end and then put it through,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i like this,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,pull it through and you can see there is our snare,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,and now the next step is to put our vinyl tubing support collar on it,subgoal
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,and this is probably i don't know,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,half an inch of vinyl tubing,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,the exact diameter of the tubing is based on what diameter cable that you're using and also what diameter support wire that you're using,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,but you're just going to slide that on the free end all the way down so that when you go to to set the snare,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,the next step is to put your swivel on and you just stick to the free end of the cable,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,i like this,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,slide that on down,instruction
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,normally i would have a smaller diameter washer with a smaller diameter hole and i would use a one sixteenth inch top button,tool
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,but i'm not the smartest guy,side note
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,now the way that works is is you can see see that cable is free to rotate inside the swivel,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,that's what allows it to swivel it,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,so at that point our snare is finished and,outcome
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,as you can see it's pretty simple,reflection
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,you know the the the thing is is when you're doing it yourself if you screw some cable up,tip
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,or if you don't have something exactly like you want it you can toss it out or or whatever,tip
kNsjE4HO7tE,Sports and Fitness,cut it up and save the parts and redo it but you're in control of it not somebody else,tip

z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,The only thing I'd recommend that I don't cover in this video is making a mark on the distributor body as well as one on the intake manifold in order to reference it later when installing the new distributor without this mark they could potentially set a check engine light code P1345.,tip
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,In which you would need a scan tool in order to set the Cam crank correlation,tip
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,Otherwise everything else should be covered in this video,briefing
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"If you need more information, like I said, check out my other video.",background info
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"Once the distributor CAP is removed, you will want to rotate the engine over the top dead center number one compression stroke",early instruction 
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"To do this, you'll want to remove the fan shroud, then manually turn the engine over until the timing mark on the balancer meets the timing mark on the timing cover with the timing marks lined up",early instruction 
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,If the distributor rotor is pointing at #1 spark plug wire then you know you have the engine in the correct position,early instruction 
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,If the rotor is pointing at #6 spark plug wire then you need to rotate the engine over and.,early instruction 
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,At that point you can go ahead and lift the distributor straight out of the engine.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"OK, looking at the new distributor, we'll notice a few marks that we want to get lined up before we install the distributor",instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"First off, we have this dimple here at the bottom of the distributor",instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,What you want to do is line that dimple up with the white painted line there.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"These marks tell us where to set the distributor before we install it, so this is the starting position of the distributor",description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,When you go to install it into the engine.,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"I took the liberty of making these two marks right here, so the purpose of these marks, this one is where our final position is",late instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,This is where our starting position is so.,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,Looking back here.,description

z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,This will tell you where this needs to face and when it's completely installed.,justification
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,It should point there.,justification
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"OK, so we got all the marks lined up as we talked about and we're going to install the distributor",subgoal
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,Make sure that that flat spot.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,On the distributor is roughly parallel.,instruction

z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,On the body of the distributor.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,And then finger tighten this bolt.,instruction
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,So you can see a few bumps with the starter,description
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,It it didn't quite want to drop down so I just wiggled the base and it dropped right down into the oil pump drive so no need to use the screwdriver to line anything up,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,That's going to waste a lot of time,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,It's much easier just to just to get this.,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"Just get that hold down right there, start it onto the base of the distributor, get the bolt run down just enough to hold it snug",late instruction

z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,"OK guys, we're going to wrap this up",transition
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,One piece of advice I will give you is if your installed distributor does not look almost identical to this then don't start the truck because you'll have to reset the top dead center on #1 cylinder and you're probably going to get a check engine light,instruction (optional)
z1Xv6Pa0toE,Cars _ Other Vehicles,It really needs to be installed almost identical to what I have here,instruction (optional)

9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,hello ladies and gentlemen ,greeting
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,today i'm working on a two thousand and twelve and a sonata,goal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,the issue we're having here is that the break lights do not work consistently,motivation
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,the third eye brake light and this one here has always worked but these side lights are not working consistently,motivation
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so they have removed some of the bulbs in them in order to keep them from burning out,briefing
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,and i believe there's a short and we're going to try to find it,briefing
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,but first i'll show you that the lights are working,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so we have all the lights working and and you can see that the running lights are actually working here,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i'm gonna go ahead and shut those off,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,nice to see that they're off baby,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,we hit the brakes so if you can see that just the third eye is lighting up,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so i'm going to diagnose and test some of this wiring and i will let you know what i find,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,they put bulbs in and they burn out very quickly,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,and just recently i noticed my neighbor was driving around and brake lights haven't been working so i figured i would offer to help them out,motivation
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,ok so you can see that all three brake lights are currently working on,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,the issue was that they kept burning out,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,what i have done to correct this problem was instead of using the factory twenty three fifty seven light bulbs,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i went with the eleven fifty seven which burned at least thirty percent cooler than those twenty three fifty sevens,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,the alternative will be to go with led lights if these happen to burnout or get too hot,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,if you install led lights you will need a load equalizer with each light,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,most kits come with two load equalizers and two led bulbs,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,it'll run you about fifty dollars,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so what i did here to fix my problem was it was actually quite simple,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,but it was just it took a while to find i was,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i came in to to the trunk,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,here you remove these felt pads,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i'll remove the ball but i'm not going to touch anything while there's power running to it,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,but you can see there bulb is on,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i'll go ahead and shut that off,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,you can see there that the socket it has been pretty hot,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,that's the only reason it'd be discolored that way,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,oh i took a the tools such as this with the power off,tool
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so you you can take that tool and you see all those little tabs in there,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,see all,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,mine is slightly sticking out well,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,those were recessed in almost like maybe it wasn't getting complete contact maybe it was getting too hot and eventually in,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,the metal was just pressed in there,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i've read that some people are having these bulbs actually cook in there melting into the socket,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,if that is the case you can purchase these at your local hardware store or parts store and you just have to cut into these three wires and splice in a new the harness like this here,instruction (optional)
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so that's a pretty straightforward deal,side note
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,this here is now and eleven fifty seven,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,instead of a twenty three fifty seven,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,it is much cooler,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i can actually take it out right after it's been on for a little bit rather than the twenty three fifty seven,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i couldn't even touch it and it actually smelt like something was burning over here,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,but these prongs,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,they get hot enough,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,on those twenty three fifty sevens,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i've seen that they are melting in there completely just melting everything,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,it's definitely a fire hazard and it definitely needs to be addressed by a hyundai,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,but until they do so or until they have a recall i am going to kick it down to eleven fifty sevens,reflection
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,and hopefully this will fix the issue,reflection
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i've tested some stuff,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,under the dash,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,there's a stop signal relay under there,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,it does not click if you test that,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,it's about a ninety dollar relay so i wouldn't just purchase it throw out the car and hopefully fix your issue,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,because chances are it won't work,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so replacing these uh knees out harness is here and putting brand new bulbs in there,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i mean brand new,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,go,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,buy them open the package put them in,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,don't just install something you have laying around,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,make sure that you know exactly what you're installing so you know how to judge the the lifespan of the ball,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,and i,reflection
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i think this will work just fine but if it does not i will install those led lights and then i'll make a video on that,reflection
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so hopefully this has helped,outro
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,thank you so much for watching and stay tuned for future videos,outro
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so i have these eleven fifty sevens installed,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,you can see them during the day,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,all of the prongs were readjusted to make sure there were good contacts,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,something else i recommend doing,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,you'll see that when you purchase lights inside the store,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,they have some grease that they recommend putting on so your sockets involves,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,don't get stuck together over time or corroded so it's just dielectric grease,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,you could take a tiny bit of this,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,squeeze them out here so just a tiny bit,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,i don't think you could accident put too much on here but then just apply it right on the end,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,here,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,you could even reply it on the outside,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,just rub it on there and that will keep it from corroding,tip
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,reinstall it and i will keep you safe for quite some time,outcome
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,in order to replace these bulbs,subgoal
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,what you'll need to do is you pop your trunk,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,you pull these little felt pads out of here,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,the carpeted pads move,effect
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,those make sure that you do not have power to your lights that we currently do not have power,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,so you will come over here to your this one,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,here on the far outside is the tail light and the brake light,description
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,you turn it,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,blurry move,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,and then install your eleven fifty seven,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,instead of this,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,twenty three fifty seven re insert it,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,these two need to be on the side,instruction
9mjXFA1TMTI,Cars _ Other Vehicles,small one needs to be straight up and then just spin it clockwise to tighten it in there and there you have,instruction

ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,I'm going to show you a really easy way to take off the keys from a desktop keyboard and then clean the inside of them and pop the keys back on,goal
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"So on keyboards like this, it doesn't matter if they're wireless or wired because they're normally attached to a desktop",background info
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"They're really easy to do and normally it's just a one piece key so laptops can be more complicated because normally there are three piece keys, so it's got the key retaining key, and then another little bit inside that with this one.",background info
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"Yeah, normally these are just one piece, so it's really straightforward to do so",background info
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"Let's say for example, if we had a problem with a bunch of keys, you might have spilt something on it",description
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Or you might just have a problem with one key before going out and getting a new keyboard,description
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"Just try doing this to start with, just try blowing it and tapping it just to see if you can get the dirt or the dust out of it, or dislodge and just try hitting it numerous times and that might just free it up",instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Give it a blow.,instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,See if it makes a difference,instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"If that still doesn't work, then we need to leave the key out, so this isn't hard to do",instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,All you need to get is a blunt knife or a Flathead screwdriver,tool (multiple)
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,And let's say now if we had a problem with.,description
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,A bunch of keys here or just the J,description
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Then I'm just going to leave it out,description
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Now,transition
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"If you've got a bunch of keys and you need to leave it out, a lot of them take a picture of it",early instruction (multiple)
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"So get your phone and take a picture of the keyboard, because there's a chance that you might forget what key goes where",early instruction (multiple)
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Either that or just write the keys down,early instruction (multiple)
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,and it will save you a headache when you've put them back together having to take them out and trying to swap them again,justification
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"So basically, let's say if we did have a problem with this J here, all I need to do is get the knife underneath it and then just leave it out and just.",instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Pop it out,instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"What I would say is when you're doing this, just make sure it's disconnected",instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,So this is just a a wireless keyboard,description
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,So just make sure it's in the off position,instruction (multiple)
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"If you've got a wired keyboard, just unplug the USB cable from your PC when you're doing it",instruction (multiple)
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Now you can see how easy that came off,outcome
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,It just popped off and then what you do is you get some,outcome
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,This is the UK so this is called surgical spirit,tool
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"If you're from America, it will probably be called rubbing alcohol",tool
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Good stuff about this is it cleans it and then it just evaporates off after a couple of minutes so you don't have to douse it in it,tool
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,just put a little bit of surgical spirits in the lid and get your Q-tip.,instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,And justice.,instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Put it in a bit of surgical spirit and then what you need to do is just clean inside,instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"So clean all around in here and hopefully that will get rid of any stickiness or grime or dirt that's gone in there and also give it a little clean inside as well, because inside here is where the actual key moves up and down so it could be sticky in there as well, so give that a clean and then you get your key.",instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,"And again, this shaft here just give it a clean.",instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,Around the edge there.,instruction
ZORD4y7dL08,Computers and Electronics,And then let it air dry for a minute or two just to get rid of to help the surgical spirit or the rubbing alcohol just evaporates off now just to show you it working on this USB keyboard,instruction

-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,what up nerds machina hair,greeting
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,and today i'm going to make an iron throne phone charger,goal
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,with the second season of demo thrones right around the corner i really wanted to make something related to it so i ended up with this,motivation
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i'm gonna use this usb cable,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i know it's purple but it's what i had and i'll fix that up later and this fits my android phone,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i'll also use two packs of these plastic cocktail swords and some other materials i'll get to soon,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i began preparing the cocktail swords by cutting off this part of the handle so this is the difference,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,now i just gotta deal with the rest of them,transition
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,at first i bought a pack of three hundred swords which turned out to be way too little so i had to buy another pack,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,and i actually ended up using all the six hundred swords,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,all right i'll put those aside,transition
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,for now,transition
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i continue to make a basic shape of the throne out of some scrap mdf i had lying around,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i marked up the size of my phone first and then drew a back piece that would be a bit wider than that,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,then i marked the seat with the same width and the death i wanted,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,finally i cut out all the pieces with a bandsaw on the back of the seat and the sides of the throne,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,here are all the pieces i used both with glue and tiny nails to attach the pieces together,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,the back piece didn't meet the sides so it was a bit wobbly but i fixed that by gluing some angled brackets to the inside with some strong epoxy glue,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,now this is what i have and what it should look like,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,to create the actual shape of the throne,subgoal
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i'll use some thick foam that i can cut into smaller pieces that looked somewhat like the shape i wanted and then use hot glue to attach it,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,it looks kind of rough at this point,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,but i gradually built up on that with more foam on top,early instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i'll add a layer of thin grey foam which will even out all the surfaces,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i did it only at the back first because i have to adjust the placement of the cable which i'll show you in a second,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i'm beginning in the long process of gluing on swords on the back first because this will determine the distance from the back to where the phone charger should be placed,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,when the back was done my lines my phone up against it and drew a line at the front,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i measured the right distance and drilled the hole through from underneath for the cable,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i had to fix it up a bit with the file to get the right shape and now it goes through,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,also drilling a path at the back so the cable can lie smoothly against the table,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,as i had the position of the phone on the charger i could build up with foam around it,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,covering that up with a thin gray foam too,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,before i continued i made sure to cover up all the other surfaces as well in several places,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,on the throne it looks like the swords are bent and twisted around some edges so i used my heat gun to warm up the plastic and bend it to the shape i needed,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,and then i could just glue it on where it fits,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i just checked how the phone fits before i started adding swords to the seat and it fits nicely,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,while gluing on the swords i left the picture up that i could use as a reference while working just to make it easier for myself,tip
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,also if you're wondering well i am color coding the sections it simply because i found it easier to actually see the depth and the layers of the swords,tip
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,where to fill in and in which direction the swords were pointed,tip
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,it would have looked more chaotic with all the colors in one place,tip
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,well at least to me,side note
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,for the top crown of the throne i only needed the blades of the swords,description
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i kept the handles as i need those lighter,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,time to glue the blades around the edge,subgoal
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,by the way we're giving away the headphones that i've made recently so if you want to participate,side note
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,make sure to check the link below,side note
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i was getting really close to the end and i just had to cover the last two sections on the back side,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,now i could use those extra handles along the edge at the top and along the three ridges on the back,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,all right nice,filler
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,all the swords have been glued on,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,looks like a very fabulous and not so iron throne,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,also the swords in the corner are all thus left of those six hundred,description
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,and i used them to cover any holes that i thought were too large,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,before painting i had to spend some time removing blue threads from in between the swords,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,when it looked nice and clean it was ready for the next step,transition
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i used the regular spray paint for indoor and outdoor projects that could be used on plastic,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i coated the whole thing black first as this will bring out the right shades i need for the iron effect,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,it needed a couple of codes from different angles to get into all the nooks and crannies,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,it already looks a lot better in black for the next layer,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i'm going to use this acrylic silver paint to make their own,tool
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,looked like it was made out of iron,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i tried the technique called dry brushing which basically means that your painting with close to no paint on the brush and justice lightly highlighting the correct parts of your object,background info
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,there's a lot of nice and detailed tutorials on dry brushing on youtube already so check that out if you're interested,background info
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i just slowly built up the iron color with several layers to not make it too bright in the wrong places,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i still wanted to keep a lot of the black as it creates the right shading effect just for comparison,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,here the right side is painted with the first layer of silver paint while the left is just a black base,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i probably could have left it with just the silver coats but i decided to use some bronze acrylic paint to create some extra depth,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i was very careful not used in much of this,description
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i added a few spots here and there,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,because too much would ruin the whole iron look,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,finally i could attach the cable to get it into the right position,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i connected it to my phone and pushed it in place,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i chose to use hot glue because despite that it might not be the strongest or most durable glue it wouldn't pour,tool 
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,found the sides of the charger and glue that to the phone,tool 
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i let it dry plugged it in and it works,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,but i still wasn't a fan of that purple cable,justification
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,so i decided to use the leftover spray to make it black,instruction
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,when that's dry it's actually done,outcome
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,it was a time consuming project but i definitely think it was worth it and it looks really badass on my desktop,reflection
-szevr-BRZE,Computers and Electronics,i hope you enjoy this build,outro

kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,If you don't know how to take body measurements,background info
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,I already did a video on my channel so feel free to watch that as well.,background info
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,The first measurements are from the neck to the waist and that is for me,instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"It's 40 centimeters, so it means that this pattern was actually 41, so I have to take away minus 1 centimeter",instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,And if I'm taking away or adding you can see the arrows,instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,That is where you have to add or take away,instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"In my case, because my back is a little bit smaller, about 1 centimeter, I need to take away minus 1 centimeter and I'm just folding my paper about 5 millimeters",instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,So together it's 1 centimeter.,instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,It's always good to take your measuring band and just to measure if the measurements are correct.,tip
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"If your back is bigger, you need to cut, open and add extra more in there",early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,Depending on your measurements,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"For example, if it's 42 you need to add 1 more centimeter extra.",early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"Moving on to the bus sign for the bus line, you're going to measure your bus for me",early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,My breasts are 92 centimeters and I divide that in half so it's 46 centimeters,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,Then I'm going to go ahead and add 4 centimeters extra,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,This is very important to add 4 centimeters extra because of the movement,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,Then you're going to divide that in half and it's 25.,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"So this means that my breasts are bigger than size 38, which means I have to add 1 centimeter extra",early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,So I'm adding one centimeter extra on the side of the Buddhist,instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"I'm making a straight line from this point to the waistline, and ",description
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"it's very important that you know that if you are making any changes on the bus line, it does affect underneath the armpit",tip
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,So you might have to add a few millimeters,tip
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,I will show you shortly in the video what I mean.,transition
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"If your breasts are smaller, then you need to maybe take away minus 1 centimeters",early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"This is exactly the same thing that I just showed you, but you're not going outwards",early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,Instead you're going inwards.,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,Moving along to the waistline,transition
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,My waistline is 72 centimeters and you have to add 4 centimeters extra because of the movement and once again you have to divide that with four,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,And in my case here I don't have to do any changes at all because it fits perfectly,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,If you have your waistline is bigger you have to increase on both sides and the incisions,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,Baseline is small,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,Then you have to take away from the front piece only in the incisions.,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,And on the back piece it's better to create one more extra incision so you will have two incisions on the back.,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,For the shoulders I'm gonna start to create a helpline that is just a straight line from the outer points of the shoulders,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,"For me, my shoulders are about 15 centimeters and it means that I have to actually add one more extra centimeter because of the movement",early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,So I'm just going to go ahead and add that.,early instruction
kPGwDxo5Yf4,Hobbies and Crafts,The last change is your bust length,subgoal

bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,and to draw in my princess seam line i'm just going to draw it in by hand so it's a nice soft curve that starts at the apex and finishes at the notch of the armhole,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,curve is curving slightly up towards the shoulder seam,description
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,i'm popping in balance marks so straight across the curve,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,i've just drawn and straight across the entire dart and this will help me out later on when i come to soul,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,because these will become notches and once i line those up correctly it will mean that my seam is all matching as it should be,justification
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,so just cutting away the side front from the front so we're cutting along that curve making sure i'm maintaining that curve when i'm cutting and cutting down the right hand side dart leg,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,so that's my y side front separated from my front,outcome
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,and now i want to remove the dart on the waist suggest cutting up the left hand side dart leg,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,and removing completely,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,this is no longer required in the prince's scene so that's gone on,description
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,and now to remove the shoulder dart,subgoal
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,same thing here,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,this is no longer required so to remove it i'm just going to cut down the left hand side dart leg,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,right down to the apex and through the apex separate that piece totally and then join up the dart legs,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,and i want to make sure that my shoulder seam is nicely joined up but the apex point is located where it should be,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,and that the dart legs are lined up right along that cut edge,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,so once i'm happy that that's all in place i'm sticking everything down,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,and now i,description
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,i just have a couple of jagged edges both on the side front and on the front and both at the apex point,description
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,so i want to soften up those edges,subgoal
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,so on the side front i'm just drawing with my french curve as a soft line so i want to remove that excess paper away from there so that i have a really lovely soft curve,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,and the piece that i'll remove's needs to be compensated on the other side and also to remove the jagged piece on the other side,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,so i'm just doing exactly the same thing here again but this time i'm adding paper,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,so just drawing in a nice soft curve there sticking everything down,instruction
bg3orsnRCVE,Hobbies and Crafts,once i'm happy that everything's in place as it should be,instruction

WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,welcome back you guys to another episode of elite fishing bros,greeting
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,today we have something very special planned,greeting
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,this episode is the first episode of a new series called the tank build up series and what i'm going to be doing in this series is building up my tank,greeting
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,catching fish raising them in the tank raising different plants,goal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,it's going to be a great time,goal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,the fish that i am planning on putting in this tank include blue gill bass and perch,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and when i say blue gill bass and perch i mean it's really small,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,bluegill bass and perch,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i'm going to try and keep it to a limit of three to four inches inside of this tank,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,anything bigger than that will not sustain in this tank,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i'm not sure how many fish i'm going to put in this tank probably around two or three,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,but that's even going to stretch a limit,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,anyway guys let's get to it all right guys,transition
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so as you can see right here behind me i got my twenty gallon long tank,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i got it at petco for about twenty dollars,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,they were having a sale one dollar per gallon so i had to get it and then over to my left,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,here i got the filter,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i have the rocks and i have the structure that i'm gonna be putting inside the tank,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,now don't worry guys i'm gonna talk about each one of those components later,transition
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,but let's get started all right,transition
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so we're going to start off with the rocks,transition
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,we're going to open the bag up and just start pouring it in,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i got a twenty pound bag of fresh water slash salt water rocks at petco for around nineteen dollars,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and knowing that i'm going to put a bass the perch or a blue gill in this tank,justification
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i got the sand colored rocks because that will best suit their habitat that they are in right now,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so after i'm done pouring that in i'm going to start spreading it around with my hands,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and the goal is to actually move the rocks on a slope from the front to the back so it adds a little bit more depth in your tank,effect
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,alright once you're done with that you're going to want to add your structure,subgoal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,now be really creative with this,subgoal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and this is what i found,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so i found this log that has sort of a hole in it so the fish can go in there for cover,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and it's also long enough to fit in the width of my tank which is pretty cool,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,but first we have to cure this,subgoal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so i'm going to show you guys how to cure it really quick and then we're going to put it in the tank,subgoal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so what you're going to want to do is get your biggest pot in the house and fill it up with water,early instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,leave a little room for the wood because once you put the wood in the water's going to rise just a little bit,early instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,let that water boil then put your wood in,early instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,try to put it in twenty minutes total,early instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so you're going to want to do ten minutes each time if it won't fit in the pot,early instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and after that take it out and you are good to go,early instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,the reason that we're boiling this wood right now is to get rid of all the unnecessary bacteria that may do harm to your plants and your fish,justification
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,all right,filler
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so while that water's boiling we're going to talk about this filter that i got i personally got a thirty gallon filter for the twenty gallon tank,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,you guys are like what should have spent ten dollars less than twenty gallon,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,well i always heard that it's better to over filter than to under filter or to even go to the level that through our filtering,justification
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so i got the thirty gallon filter right here,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,we're going to open it up and put it on,subgoal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,all right,filler
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so when you first open this thing up it's going to be pretty big actually,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,oh my gosh it looks like the tops coming out,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,first take the filter out of the box all right,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so you got a bunch of stuff in the package that you just got in your filter box,description
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i'm going to open up the instructions and read but it's got to say all right,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so the first step is to check and see if there's any damage done to your filter,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,alright so step two it says to remove new cartridge from bag and rinse under cold water to remove carbon dust,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,step three install cartridge as shown,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,all right,filler
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,then it says to slide it in here,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,you're going to see two slots that you slide it into and bam that looks like it's done,outcome
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,step four if the pump is already assembled check the correct position of it,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,it was not already assembled but we just did that,side note
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,all right,filler
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and then it comes with this piece that was not very specified in the instructions but looks like it just slides in here like that and you're good to go,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,alright a kind of just found the secret compartment inside the filter,tool
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so if you reach in the right hand corner of the filter you're going to find this,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,this is crucial,description
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i thought i didn't have it for a second but it's in the corner,description
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,looks like it just snaps on it,description
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,then the last thing you're gonna do is put the roof on the filter,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,that's pretty self explanatory,side note
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so once you have your filter all set up and ready to go all you're going to do is take the filter and place it right over the tank like that,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,i'm going to put it on the left side and you are good to go,outcome
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,all right you guys to,outcome
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,the log is finally done boiling,outcome
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,but what i am going to do is i'm going to take a paper towel and just start rubbing away that extra stuff that needs to come off like that,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,big jump just came off all right,description
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so once you have all the extra wood and dirt off of your cover then you're going to want to put it in your tank,subgoal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,now be really creative with this,tip
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so that it really draws the eye to the back of the tank kind of what i did with the sand,effect
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,that looks pretty good right there,outcome
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and the reason i chopped it is because my original plan was to tie something on that would weigh it down,justification
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,huh,filler
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,and and the reason i positioned it slammed like that is so i can add depth to the tank,justification
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so now that we have everything situated in the tank we are going to add the water conditioner,subgoal
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,looks like you just pour it right in there just like that,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,so we're going to place this plant in there right along the edge here,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,put some rocks to weigh it down and that should be good right there,instruction
WoDZQRGyuHA,Pets and Animals,make sure to stay tuned for my next video where i go out catch a fish and put it in this tank,outro

ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Pulling off a good green screen starts with the correct setup and not only saves you time and stress and boost, but also gives you way better results",motivation
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,So let's head over to the garage,transition
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,ant to take a step by step note to achieve a great green screen on a budget.,goal
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Hey folks Jordan here for cinecom.net and welcome to the channel that is all about creative filmmaking with premiere Pro and Basic Phillip equipment,greeting
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,We shoot all of our episodes in our Green Screen studio,side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"We've made a permanent setup, but for the purpose of this tutorial, we'll make a new setup and a more common environment",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Most of us don't have access to expensive studio equipment, so that's why we're going to set-up a green screen.",motivation
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"In the garage, for most homes this is usually a dark place or it only has some small windows which we could easily tape off",description
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"The idea is to start from a blank page, which means a completely dark room ",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"setting up a green screen is rather simple, but lighting it is a different story",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Later in this video you'll see that we have to create two lighting zones, which means we're going to need some space as well",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Your talent has to take some distance from the green screen and the camera too,justification
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"So not only we need a dark room, but also the space.",justification
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,You put up everything which recommends to have at least 4 meters or about 13 feet from the wall to wall,briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,and this tutorial video you'll see that we'll be using all sorts of materials from the garage,briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"There are hundreds of ways to put up and light a green screen, so your situation might be a little different on what you have laying around at home",briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,but it's important to follow the techniques shown so you can get similar results,briefing
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,So we've got a room,tool
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,The next thing is the green screen itself,tool
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Now this fabric is not something special.,tool
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"If you like, you can also get this at a local fabric store, but I would suggest to just get a real green screen as they are actually pretty cheap",tool (multiple)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"You can find fabrics for as low as 20 bucks or even 50 bucks for a whole set with stands and everything, but the way everything mentioned here is listed in the description below",tool
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,The way you set-up your green screen doesn't matter that much with is important though is that you don't see any wrinkles,early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"In other words, make sure to tighten this screen",early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,This is best done by having two stands and one pole on top of that.,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Then use some clamps to stretch and tighten the fabric,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"You can also craft a wooden frame and tighten your green screen in there, but it's less portable",instruction (optional)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Basically, anything will do just as long as you can tighten the fabric",justification
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,This was the easy part,side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Now comes the lighting which will make the difference between a good or bad Chroma Key,subgoal
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"And like I said before, we're going to create two lighting zones, one for the green key and one for the subject, and it's important that they don't interfere with each other, but.",subgoal
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Let's start with the first zone,subgoal
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Lighting the green screen ,subgoal
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,like you might have heard somewhere else,filler
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,It's important to light the fabric evenly over the whole surface,early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"You want to avoid having hotspots, which means that there are spots which are more illuminated than the rest of the surface",instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"You want to have at least one light at each site,",early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,but even then it's sometimes hard to spread the light evenly over the surface,description
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,This is why we're going to create a large softbox ,early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"when light is diffused, it spreads better over the surface.",justification
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Cheapest solution is to hang a white cloth and each science and place your lights behind it,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,I have attached two work lights to each site so that I both illuminate the top and the bottom of the screen,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,This technique will work with any kinds of lights,tool (multiple)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,If you have some light bulbs laying around or like to craft something of your own it will work perfectly,tool (multiple)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Those who like to learn more about using work lights like we do for video, just click on a cart up there to learn more",background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,You can of course also use LED panels here and they can't even be of a lower quality.,tool (multiple)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Cheap LED lights will cast green colors, but since they're pointing towards a green screen it doesn't really matter that much",tool (multiple)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Lighting zone one is complete,outcome
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Make sure to check if the lighting is even over the whole surface,early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,You can do that by quickly keying it and post and see how it goes,early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"If you notice differences there, adjust the position and the angle of your lighting",early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"We're halfway, so let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor of this video",transition
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"If you like to advertise on Facebook, make sure it's a little video and attracts a lot more attention.",side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,And video blogs,side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,We can find this awesome Starburst clip,side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Drag it into premiere pro, but make sure that you're working in a square resolution, for example 1080 by 1080",side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,This is best for mobile users as everyone holds their phone vertically,side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Then enter text to it and upload it to facebook visit video blogs.com for more templates and stock footage,side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Full link in the description below,side note
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Welcome back everyone,transition
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Let's take a look at lighting zone #2 now this is going to be the lighting on your subject,subgoal
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"First of all, you want to make sure that the Right from the green screen is not interfering,",early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,so trying to find a spot where the reflection from behind is as minimum as possible,instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,You might need to flap off any spill light with a black fabric or some carton boards,instruction (optional)
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Once you've got that out of the way, we can focus on the subject, ",description
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"but also here with the subject lighting you want to make sure that it's not interfering with the green screen light, so that's vice versa",early instruction
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"A common mistake is that your subjects will cast shadows on the green screen, and you want to avoid that at any cost.",tip
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Q Easy Solutions is to take distance from the green screen and to use soft lights on the front of the subject,tip
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,You're basically two kinds of lightings,background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"A basic illumination for presentations like the three-point lighting setup, and again you can click in the cards up there to learn more about that or a certain setup that matches the light scene of what's going to be your backgrounds",background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"For example, if our background is a sunset at the beach, then make sure to add that sunlight on the subject as well",background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,You wouldn't have a warm heart.,background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Why it's coming from the back and a soft fill light from the opposite side to lift up the shadows? ,background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,Very important here though is that we must pay attention to the type of lighting we use on the green screen,background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,You have daylights and tungsten lights,background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"If you use tungsten lights in the background, then we have to change our wide balance to it",background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,This makes those warm lights appear as natural white in camera,background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,This is very important to capture a vivid green color,background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"If your white balance is set wrong, you will have a mix between yellow.",background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Against Green, which is going to be a lot harder to key in post",background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"So if you have tungsten lighting in the back which appears as natural light and camera, your subject lights will also appear colder than reality",background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,If you like warm colors on your subject then you might need to add some orange filters in front of those lights to get a warm tune,background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"So even though you're too, lighting zones are separated, you need to adjust the color temperature to each other",background info
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,If you follow these steps you should be able to get a good green.,outcome
ZT1dvq6yacQ,Arts and Entertainment,"Being result now, those with some budget who would like to build out a more permanent studio",background info

VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,how did you start painting murals,greeting
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so the question i asked myself for years before i got this gig and this gig this past summer,greeting
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i hope i can answer some of your questions,goal
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,alright guys let's get into it,transition
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,how do you start painting murals and want to start from a beginner's perspective,goal
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,when you first start out you really have to have solid ability on paper on canvas on a smaller scale before you even think about going any larger,early instruction
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so what are some of your options,transition
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i went to college in the boston area massachusetts really near talem beverly and in beverly there is this legal wall,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,they call it free wall the graffiti wall and they also call it life hall of famer,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,and that was where i really got their first shot at what it was like to paint something larger,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,and it was amazing,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,it was exciting but i was also extremely lucky to have that fifteen minutes away because i probably did ten to twenty pieces on that wall,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,here's the thing,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,you're not going to be able to keep,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,it's it's not,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,we're not able to keep the peace it's not going to stay on the wall,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i even a lot of times paying a piece,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,that next weekend i rolled over the piece i created i would destroy the and that's something that could be pretty hard,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,you destroy the piece you create but after a while it becomes a habit,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,and the real key is you're documenting it via photography,late instruction
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,all right,filler
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,and so where i was initially just shooting it off my iphone i now have a professional grade dsr hairless camera that i'm taking my shots with,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so that's key is producing and documenting,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,now they're like hey i don't have a legal free wall near me,description
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i went on legal walls dot net,description
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i couldn't find anything,description
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,what are my other options,subgoal
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,another option is to find yourself a plywood board,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,yeah just a plywood board,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,go to home depot go to your local hardware store and start painting on a plywood board,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,a lot of the early works that i did were really not that much taller than me,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,a couple of things here as well,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i started using spray paint,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,there were a lot of muralists who were not even using spray paint where they're just using rollers and they're using paint brushes,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so don't be restricted by that,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,but i have a huge tip for you guys who are really into the spray paint,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,just as i was,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,and that is cello art cello graffiti,tool (multiple)
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,let me show you what that looks like,transition
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,boom,filler
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,here it is sello artillery affitti,tool
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,this i got a local hardware store,tool
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,it's just like plastic wrap,tool
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,this i gotten molotovs are actually a it's at a physical store but you can probably get this stuff online,tool
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,and this is also sell oprah,tool
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,but this is in black so you can be painting from dark to light,tool
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,for beginners this is really a great way to go ,tip
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,once you build up some sort of base of portfolio this is how we really when the momentum when you start to snowball effects happens,instruction
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,because you can start pitching projects to people,effect
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,for example i pitched a project to an organization in sri lanka,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so really quite a long story,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,but in the end i was able to go around sri lanka and paint in local schools and do relatively large scale,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,girls what did this do,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,well it built up my portfolio even further to then pitch other projects and do other things,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i end up traveling to finland and made my own project and this is really what's important here,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,art is flexible and it's in in a certain way,side note
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,it's really about people's perceptions of what you're doing,side note
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,you don't have to actually necessarily have a legitimate project to make it seem legitimate in the eyes of others,side note
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so i went to finland,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i found multiple free walls,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,again legal walls dot net,tip
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,you can see a lot more,tip
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,free wall is actually in finland and i built up my portfolio even further,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,it's a long story but i had to actually moving to finland and i continue to build my portfolio,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,but this time with slightly more organized events,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so there was a block party and i got to paint this truck,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,and then there was an event where a group of guys were able to get a building that they were going to tear down,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,the piece that i did there became really popular in the city and the next year i was asked by the same group of guys and they had one spot for an artist to go on a lift and do a piece,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so they called me and he said hey can you give it a shot and i asked like yeah for for somebody,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,yeah of course,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i've been waiting past three years to to to get on a lift which for me was really deciding factor because on a lift you're really quite close to the wall and you have to really get all the way down to look back at your art,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so got the opportunity,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i hustled,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i like only two and a half days to do it,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i was painting in the night with the headlamp,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,it was a crazy story,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i nailed the mural and it actually got on the cover of the local newspaper,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,so then some of the companies that were in the area thought one of the owners said this is a sick idea,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i want this guy to paint one of my buildings and that's as of that was a couple of months ago and that was an incredible opportunity because that was my first paid mural gig,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,and that was,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,i think it was about three or four stories high that the building and so again awesome,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,big time for that and and it was just an incredible experience,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,alright guys hope this helps,outro
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,in summary find a spot to do your work,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,two get it online of some some kind where there's an instagram account a facebook page or website,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,you gotta have your portfolio somewhere accessible,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,number three start pitching projects and start one upping yourself every time,reflection
VEplLGXFLFw,Arts and Entertainment,set yearly goals,reflection

EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,hey there i'm alan matthews from classical guitar shed and in this video we're going to be looking at a capo,greeting
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,in this video we're going to be looking at a capo,goal
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,what is a capo,goal
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,why would you use a capo,goal
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,how do you use a capo,goal
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,do i need a capo,goal
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,all these questions and more will be answered in just a second,transition
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,so why would you use this,subgoal
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,well there are a few different ways,description
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,few different reasons why you would actually use a capo,description
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,first off is if you are playing chords along with a singer or something like that and you're playing along and they say,subgoal
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,a little bit more so it's a little bit instead of having and then you could bring it up a couple of frets and it's just a little bit brighter,description
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,so that's one of the reasons that a lot of flamenco players will use this as well,justification
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,i don't know if that's a reason that flamingo players do it or not but it's a benefit because it just makes the instrument a little bit easier to get around on right here,justification
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,so that's the second reason,transition
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,a third reason is that a composer you piece of classical guitar music or something a composer may use this for a particular reason,subgoal
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,and so it will just make the instrument sound like a higher pitched instrument ,effect
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,it's the exact same thing it's called affected guitar and it is just a special technique and very cool,background info
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,so beware of that possible pitfall or just move it around enough that you get really versatile playing with a capo,tip
EYL1tYGwYY0,Arts and Entertainment,so hope you've enjoyed this foray into capos,outro
