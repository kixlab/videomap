Hi guys, it's the eighth as you can see.
Omg Omg Omg isn't it Pretty give or take a couple specs.
So I'm about to go and put their receiving blanket up there so they don't start peeing on the fleece.
Well, they could if they wanted to.
but Tom as you can see, lots of room to play now.
Ok I'll be back.
Lots to do this morning.
I've got to pay the success for shipping.
Apparently there is shipping by fight for Arbor feisty chinchillas.
but I didn't know how so I couldn't do it anyway.
So I had to wait for them today.
sorry email me back.
So I'm just going to go ahead and do this quickly.
give them their morning hey and then I'll get started on the online stuff.
