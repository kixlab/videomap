Okay, I just told him like I'm like like this and then I grab his foot, take the inside one so there's an outside and inside and shove his leg through.
got the outside, spread it over his bottom, the same thing on the side, up and then for extra security.
I just I grab his leg again like this, it's easier for me to tuck this way.
I do this and I grab right back here.
just peel down and it's like to pop out.
Not much does he weigh now 22 pounds, 22 pounds and then I take this piece of fabric that's going around and really lower it so it finds your love handles well when you're writing jeans and it pops out.
This does make it look any better if you have it the wrong position.
So and you work to feel good if they all sleep, you can tuck their arms in like this.
then even with him his head can go in here.
he'll just go to sleep with going to the grocery store or Target or any of those things or he can have his hometown.
You can do the exact same thing facing outward if you want to and there's a bunch other holds, but this is the one that we like the best and that's it.
And I can wear him for at least an hour at a time, if not two before my back even starts to even get bothered by it.
So with little ones me working over like six hours of water.
