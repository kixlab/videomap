Hi Dog lovers!
This week we're making this giant Pizza peanut butter cookie.
We're going to need flour, baking powder, rolled oats, smooth peanut butter, some honey, fish oil and water.
Mix the flour, the oats and the baking powder together in a large bowl.
Now pour in some water we want just enough to make the mixture moist but not too wet.
Add the peanut butter and honey.
and lastly, we're going to add the fish oil caps.
The quantities and conversions will be left in the description box below.
Sprinkle a generous amount of flour onto a cooking surface, knead the dough, and transfer onto another floured surface ready for rolling.
Moving Roland's decided to take a little nip roll the cookie dough until it resembles that nice round peak to shape we're looking for.
We need to bake this in a moderate oven for about 20 minutes.
Once it looks nice and golden brown and crispy.
Removed from the oven and begin to decorate.
Spread a generous amount of the peanut butter around the entire base of the cookie.
Sprinkle with cheese and topped with sliced frankfurters.
Now sprinkle with a little bit of sliced cut parsley.
This is a great idea if you've got lots of puppies coming around for a playdate.
