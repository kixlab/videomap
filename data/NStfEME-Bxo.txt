Hi my name is Robert Hogan and in this video I'm going to show you how I made a metal Batman mask I Made this mask for a friend of mine.
He wanted a more battle-damaged version of the Batman mask.
I marked and cut out the pieces I needed out of 18 gauge sheet metal.
Here are all the pieces: cut out and ready to be formed.
I First started with the forehead portion of the mask.
I use the shrinker and the English will to form the piece.
I Use pliers and multiple hammers to shape the eyebrow.
I welded two two halves together and ground them smooth.
Next, I'm moving on to the size of the mask again.
I'm using a hammer to shape the piece in the English wheel to smooth out the hammer marks.
I'm using the pliers to shape what will soon be the eye opening still using them pliers I continue to browbeat ale onto the side of the mask I then tacked both sides of the mask to the forehead portion.
Then I use the sheet metal break to form the nose piece and tacked it into place.
Now I'm moving on to the cheap pieces.
I'm using a hammer and anvil to form them now.
I'm tack welding the cheek pieces into place.
Then I welded a mask and ground it smooth Next I moved on to the ears again.
I use pliers and a hammer to shape the ears.
Then I marked and cut out where the ear will attach now I'm welding both ears into place.
Then I marked out some Battle Damage that I'll be adding to the mask using the die grinder.
I Cut in the Battle Damage for this build I Decided to go with a powder coat finish.
For those of you that don't know what powder coat is, it is a plastic powder that is baked on.
Now the mask is complete.
If you have any suggestions of what you would like to see me build next, leave them in the comments below or on top.
Okay you.
