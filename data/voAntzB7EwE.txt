Hi, I'm Richard.
this is Sarah and we're going to perform the Amazing color changing car trick with this blue backed deck of cards.
Now the idea is very simple.
I'm just going to spread the cards in front of Sarah and ask her to push any card towards the camera.
All right.
Okay, let's see.
I want to go for this card here.
Okay, now, Sarah could have selected any card at all from the deck, but she selected the card which is now face down on the table.
What I'm going to ask her to do is show us which card she selected right?
So the card that I chose was in fact there's three of diamonds.
The three of diamonds.
Okay, excellent choice.
That card goes back into the deck.
Now I'm just going to spread the cards face up on the table, Do a little click of the fingers and you'll see that Sarah's card here has now got a blue back.
Not particularly surprising.
What's slightly more surprising is all of the other cards have got red backs and that is the Amazing color changing card trick.
