Basic steps to setting up a slackline start with finding two anchors likely trees that are 15 to 25 feet apart.
Always wrap protection around the tree to protect it and the light to attach the main line to the tree, wrap it around the trunk and through the sown loop.
Pull the webbing in half lengthwise as it passes through the loop.
This ensures it will lay flat once it's tight, making it easier to walk on.
Attach the tensioning side the same way by passing the ratchet through the sone loop and making sure to fold the line once again to hold it flat.
Be sure there are no twists in the line, beat it through the ratchet and pull all the slack through.
Make sure the bulk of the ratchet is on the bottom to keep the line from block, pull up on the safety catch to bring the lever into the lock position close to the ratchet.
let the catch re-engage the teeth.
As a minimum, you need enough tension so you don't hit the ground in the middle of the line.
The tighter the line is, the easier it will be to walk on to take the line down, pull up on the safety catch and keep opening the handle until the tension is released.
So come on into REI and get everything you'll need to start slackline.
You.
