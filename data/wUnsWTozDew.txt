A Gamma is a facial scrub.
It's a little different and almost it's a little Messier to use than your traditional face facial scrubs.
It's very thick and consistency if you can see and it's creamy and you just want to use a very light application.
But you take your fingers and you kind of warm it up a little bit before applying it and you want to spread it a very thin layer across the entire face and again it's a wet product but as it dries, it only takes a few minutes to dry and as it dries, you're gonna use your fingertips to gently slough off the product so the product is going to be it dried in just a minute and as it dries, you're gonna gently use your fingertips to remove the excess and in doing so, it's gonna feel kind of like dry eraser shavings to your client, but that is gonna remove any flakiness dryness.
Basically the top surface layers of our skin are pretty much dead skin cells anyway.
so by using a product like this it's really gonna soften and just give you that baby soft feeling that most of us are striving to get.
So I'm just gonna let it kind of set up a few minutes and you just want to kind of feel around and make sure it's not tacky because if it's still tacky, it's still drying and we want to make sure it's nice and dry so that we can really get a good exfoliation out of the product and on her skin.
So as this product dries it usually takes about two minutes or so.
we'll just wait a few minutes.
