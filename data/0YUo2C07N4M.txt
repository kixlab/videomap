Hi I'm Erin Henley professional makeup artist and today I'm going to explain the differences between exfoliating your skin and not exfoliating skin.
The difference is really, really apparent with someone that hasn't exfoliated their skin.
Most of the time they have flakiness going on and just a bunch of dry skin that is on the top of their surface.
And so what happens is when they apply their moisturizers or their foundations and eye makeup that it tends to read and be a little grainy and texturized and that's something we want to eliminate at all costs.
So going in with exfoliating where there's many ways to do so with a washcloth or a toothbrush twice a week.
and I'm just going to show you how an exfoliated face can read makeup very well.
and I'm just going in with our primer and a bit of a luminizer and show you how well exfoliating skin can really read makeup.
If this person did not have exfoliated skin, it would probably cake up and be grainy and texture something that we really want to avoid.
And it's important to exfoliate at least twice a week.
but don't over exfoliate.
So twice a week or three times a week is the best way to go.
On top of keeping exfoliated, it's important to keep moisturized because if you don't exfoliate, it'll be dry and that will lead to lack of moisture.
So it's important to combine the two together, especially if you're wearing makeup because makeup can definitely enhance and enhance unexfoliated skin.
I'm Erin Henley and I just showed you the difference between exfoliated and non-exfoliated skin.
