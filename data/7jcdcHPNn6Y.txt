Okay, well I stopped by my neighborhood Chinese tool store to get some stuff and I had been planning on building.
uh I saw these videos for slack lines on the internet and I thought well maybe that sword have something similar to and that did find something on sale.
this ratchet tie-down strap that can hold 3,300 pounds.
So I think that will probably do for a ghetto slack line that I'm gonna put up instead of a name-brand one.
but so I got these webbing slings I'm going to try these in around the trees first.
I'm gonna run the slack line between two trees so this will help keep the tree from getting damaged.
So let's see if I can get this to work like a regular name-brand slackline aid that I've seen online for a lot more.
this was I think 16 dollars is on sale.
just sixteen dollars, 27 feet by 2 inch webbing.
I think that's about the same size as a lot of the beginner slack lines.
and then I got these other 2 inch webbing slings.
these are each I believe $8 each.
By the end of that, stop here.
Man, that's pretty tight.
Yeah, my kids have been enjoying the slackline.
It seems to be working pretty well.
kind of bouncy.
I can actually tighten it up a little bit more.
the I think it's pretty strong.
try to go down it.
There you go.
you.
