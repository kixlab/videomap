Do you need a paper and fold it diagonally and make sure that the edges very shy and then turning that foldable dist crease very hard menu.
You will have this fall and keep it and see the people on this line and then fold it back then keep your hand and push it and then this will be discharged.
You have to push it down and then you will get to for ages and take our edge and fold it up something like this.
do this same thing all the four sides after after you've done this, turn it back and do the same thing afternoon it will get something like this and then keep it like this and then this edge to the middle and this edge to this edge and make a very tight please.
Then do this also at that and do the same thing all the better.
After don't it looks like this and you will have a small pocket here and open it.
Take this and put it themselves and then make a crease.
