What's up guys?
I'm Dan And because you asked for it today, we're going to be making mask of Magnum in tea and Kate's gonna be compounding.
[Music] A cool thing about masks a magnum ad is that it's not only for your face, but it's also for your body as well.
Massa Magnum Inti gets its color from chlorophyll powder, which is a plant extract and you can see Kate mixing that up right now.
Once she's finished completely mixing in the color, she's going to add it to a vessel of water.
She'll follow that up by adding a bentonite powder which will help thicken it up.
An interesting thing about bentonite powder is that it actually is derived from the weathering of volcanic ash.
Will now add the glycerin.
The glycerin we use at Lush is all vegetable base.
Now, because Kate's making the self-preserving version of this formula, she'll be adding in tons of honey to act as a natural preservative.
So the last of the liquids to go into this mix is the fragrance that includes peppermint oil and Fairtrade vanilla absolute.
and if you're familiar with it, you know it's pretty minty.
Next, Kate we'll be adding the evening Primrose seeds which will act as our natural exfoliant.
Next is our Kahlan and Artell powder.
Both of these clays are deep cleansers and they also help form the consistency of the mix itself.
And last but not least, Kate we'll be adding the ground to Dukey beans.
Those are the little scrubby bits you feel in there and they're super exfoliating.
[Music] and that's how you make masks.
